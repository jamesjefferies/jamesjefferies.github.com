svcadm is the service admin command line thing on solaris

e.g. svcadm enable tomcat will switch on the tomcat managed service

if a service doesn't start

svcs - all services

svcs -xÂ  services with exceptions (in maintenance mode)

svcs -x -v as above, more verbose

svcadm clear tomcat - clears any exceptions
