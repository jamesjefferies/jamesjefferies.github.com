      <p>This week has been a bit wonky.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday</strong> was a triumph, getting Cathy and Heathcliff doing something useful as part of Bill Drummond&#8217;s sixth form workshop. It certainly warmed the cockles &amp; Leila has written some more about it on her post.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> was a day where we were part of Site&#8217;s Brand Innovation task force, looking at Site&#8217;s &#8216;Brand Promise&#8217;. This was jam packed and a bit of a brain strain, but we made a contribution and as we were observed by our illustrious researcher, we hopefully gave him something to write about!</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> went a bit wonky as my daughter was poorly meaning the day was very broken up. I started having a look at Ruby, the programming language whilst thinking about how we could get Cathy &amp; Heathcliff to interact a bit more with Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday</strong> was the day of working out how to get Cathy and Heathcliff mobile. A frustrating day as the components and bits and bobs we bought didn&#8217;t work or wouldn&#8217;t work how we wanted them to. We ended the day though with a 3G dongle and an ethernet to USB connector which hopefully means that if we can take a Mac, a dongle, a lead, a printer &amp; some sort of power supply then we can take them anywhere where there is a mobile signal and they&#8217;ll work.</p>

<p>We also spent a fair bit of time thinking about our contribution to <a title="Future Everything" href="http://futureeverything.org/">Future Everything</a> which is next week, meep!</p>
