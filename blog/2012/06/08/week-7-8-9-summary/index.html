<div class="entry-content"><p>Oh dear, what happened to week 7, 8 blog posts (I hear you ask)?</p>

<p>Good question. Here&#8217;s a little re-cap of what you missed (thanks <a href="http://offbott.com/">offbott</a> for the reminders!)</p>

<h3>Week 7</h3>


<p>This week was mainly taken up with:</p>

<ul>
    <li>creating a test version of the site gallery website, so that we could have a good tinker with the layout</li>
    <li>investigating the building&#8217;s network wiring and working out how we could get the office in to a better shape</li>
    <li>an official rehearsal for our TedX Sheffield talk</li>
</ul>


<h3>Week 8 - the broken back week</h3>


<p>I really kernackered my back on Wednesday morning, which meant that I ended up working a bit on .. ahem.. Cathy &amp; Heathcliff&#8217;s back ends from home. Thursday was a bit better and we came up with the idea of building a &#8216;who&#8217;s in the house&#8217; lighting board. Leila has been doing lots of soldering. Our IP camera arrived on Friday and we had it looking around the office with it&#8217;s spooky eye.</p>

<h3>Week 9 - the TedX and Sheffield Doc/Fest Week</h3>


<p>Tuesday was Sheffield TedX and we were invited to do a 10 minute talk as part of the whole shebang. We managed to get Heathcliff working by borrowing a MacMini from Site, getting it to pick up the Wi-fi in the Crucible (yes, THAT crucible in Sheffield) and share it&#8217;s ethernet connection. Attendees could then send SMS to Heathcliff and up in the refreshment area, he&#8217;s print out their messages.</p>

<p>We weren&#8217;t in the main part of the Crucible, but the Crucible studio which has room for about 270 people. I will confess and say that I felt the pressure for this one. Speaking in front of 270 people is one thing, being filmed ready for the TedX channel on YouTube is something else again!</p>

<p>I think we did ok and people had nice things to say about us. Hurrah! The other speakers were, in the main, fantastic! Inspiring stuff.</p>

<p>Then, Wednesday was the <a href="http://www.xolabs.co.uk/2011/11/01/xo-summit-expo-2012/">XO Summit</a> as part of Doc/Fest, which I managed to&#8230; errr, attend. Bumped in to and had a chat with the Right Honourable Honor Harger and caught up with some people I&#8217;d met the day before.</p>

<p>Thursday was more Cathy &amp; Heathcliff re-writing. Getting rid of the awful PHP which we&#8217;d used initially and the gmail to ifttt to twitter thing and replacing it with a bit of Ruby and Sinatra which I got running on Heroku (was it any co-incidence that Heroku had a major outage overnight afterwards? I hope so!)</p>

<p>Then today.. blogging ahoy!</p>
