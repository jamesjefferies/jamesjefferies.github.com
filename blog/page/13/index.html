  <div class="entry-content"><p>On Sunday afternoon I was chatting to my neighbour Nikki with her young lad Sunny. He was armed with a water pistol and before I knew it, I was engaged in full scale water battle! It was hilarious and reminded me what a child I am at heart! Both of us ended up wet but happy&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This morning I was woken by an explosion around 5am - when I looked up, I could see red flickering reflecting on the ceiling, consequently I jumped out of bed, put my specs on and looked out of the window. There was a car, on fire opposite my house!</p>

<p>Immediately I phoned the fire brigade and was slightly off put by a voice reading out my mobile phone number, I suspect for the recording. I said there was a car on fire and gave the name of my street, but forget to tell them the city! Once they sorted that out, they said a fire engine would be on it&#8217;s way.</p>

<p>I threw on some clothes, got the car keys and went outside, a bit scared in case there was a further explosion. Noticing that Clare&#8217;s number plate had melted on her car, I quickly hopped in and drove it up the street. The plastic bumper had buckled a bit, but I think it&#8217;ll be ok. The number plate is just a mess.</p>

<p>Then I got my car and moved it out of the way too, taking no chances. At that point the fire engine turned up and they started to put the fire out.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t know whether it was joyriders, just setting it on fire at the end of the road, or a neighbours car which had developed an electrical fault, set itself on fire and rolled down the hill, or some other explanation.</p>

<p>Needless to say, I went back to bed, but couldn&#8217;t sleep because of the adrenaline! By the time I did feel dozy, it was time to get up for work.. harumph!</p>

<p>The car was there when I left, a wreck, blocking the road at one end.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I found this via <a href="http://jamesandclare.net/life/basement.org">basement.org</a> and as I like underground maps and things like that, especially the London Underground, this made fascinating viewing.</p>

<p>The website has a proposed <a href="http://jamesandclare.net/life/www.kickmap.com">new design</a> of the New York Subway map and is well worth a look&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Well, Newcastle Academy is an interesting place, old theatre kind of venue with a balcony and standing area downstairs. Which is great, I love &#8216;em, except that the only way in and out were two doors at the back, up two sets of stairs! From there there was a lobby with two more sets of stairs heading down each side. A recipe for queueing to get out, scrambling over empty plastic glasses - no fun.</p>

<p>We walked past the fire exits which would have been a good way of clearing the venue quickly, but there were venue staff on the doors keeping us in line. It was hot, smelly and unpleasant. One guy, claiming claustrophobia, made a dash for the door, barging everyone out of his way until he found he couldn&#8217;t get out that way, upon which, after ranting and raving, he calmed down and pushed back in the queue. I was not happy! If you get claustrophobic, you don&#8217;t go down to the front of a gig!</p>

<p>The Venue management need to sort that out&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Went to see James last night, who&#8217;ve recently reformed with one of their classic line ups. The venue was the Newcastle Academy and John and I drove up after work in fast mini, via the chippy in Thirsk. We missed the support band, but got there in time to fight our way to the queue for the lav, then the queue for the bar, then down to a good position to the left of the stage about half way down.</p>

<p>There was a real sense of anticipation for the band coming on stage and the whole place (2000 people) erupted when they did, starting the set with the classic song &#8216;Come Home&#8217;.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll post the set list later, but they did two encores plus what you&#8217;d expect from a James gig, Sit Down, Tomorrow, Sometimes, She&#8217;s a Star - fantastic.</p>

<p>The set list was a mix of ancient and modern, hits and obscurities which in my book was great. However, people gabbing away during the new songs and more obscure songs was irritating.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How come Oracle 10g comes with so many nice things which are advertised as working &#8216;out of the box&#8217; but actually a licence fee is paid. This wouldn&#8217;t be so bad if the company refuses to pay the extra licences to access all of the performance tweaking goodies we need!</p>

<p>Honestly, I tear my hair out :(</p>
