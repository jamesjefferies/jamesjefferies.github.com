  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week has given us a real opportunity to do something interesting with Cathy &amp; Heathcliff, we spent two of our three days out of the Site office to get our heads down.</p>

<p>The first challenge was to allow 6th Formers to send messages to Cathy &amp; Heathcliff. At first we thought of hooking them up directly to twitter accounts, but as Leila had a <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> account, it meant that we could do something clever with SMS Text messages. With a bit of PHP magic on an intermediary server (timescales demanded a quick turnaround!) we managed to get the SMS messages sent to the two printers. Hooray!</p>

<p>The next step was to bypass the button on the Arduino device which you had to push each time a message arrived. We edited the C code and uploaded the new code to the devices so that instead of waiting for the button to be pushed, the green light flashed and it printed without intervention. Hooray x 2!</p>

<p>Finally, we wanted to get the messages sent to Cathy and Heathcliff&#8217;s twitter accounts - @CathyPrinter @HeathcliffPrinter - initially we looked a using the PHP OAuth libraries to authenticate and send the message to twitter, but as neither of us are particularly adept at PHP, we decided on a different solution. Using <a href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That</a> and some server side magic, we send an email from the server, via their gmail accounts to If This Then That, which then passes them on to their twitter accounts.. Hooray x 3!</p>

<p>You can see us setting them up on our <a href="http://happenstancesheffield.tumblr.com">tumblr site</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week has all been about pairs of trousers. It has rained a lot and usually when you are equidistant from where you are going and where you want to go, the heavens open and you get absolutely soaked. I&#8217;ve been through three pairs of trousers and counting.</p>

<p><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rain-620x620.jpg" alt="rain" /></p>

<p>So trousers.. and marketing/branding innovation labs, meeting with yet more interesting people, fixing the internet and eating flapjack.</p>

<p>To distract us from the weather and all these other things we&#8217;ve had the excitement of two receipt printers which we are bringing to life. The illustrious <a href="http://twitter.com/lazyatom">James Adam</a> has written a fantastic <a href="http://gofreerange.com/hello-printer">article</a> about how to build internet enabled receipt printers. My advice would be to go away and read that, when you&#8217;re done, come back here!</p>

<p>So we have been guinea pigs, taking delivery of two printers complete with special <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">arduino</a> kits, leads and other <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gubbins">gubbins</a>. Of course, all we needed to do was plug them in (following the instructions) and BOOM! The little printers would burst in to life&#8230;.</p>

<p><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/heathcliff12-463x620.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#8230; except they did not :(</p>

<p>The little light flashed to say that it was talking to the internet, but the internet didn&#8217;t want to speak back. This was a blow, was it the printer, was it the lead, was it the network, was it the circuitry, was it the &#8216;sketch&#8217; (the arduino program)? So we put on our best Worzel Gummidge problem solving heads and got to work. We broke in to the server room and tried a direct connection (rather than through all the office switches and routers), fired up skype and waved the laptop in the direction of the kit whilst the illustrious one watched from afar. No joy.</p>

<p>We knew that one of the other tenants in the building used a different internet connection, so we took one of the printers up there and plugged it in. It burst into life and the backlog of messages we&#8217;d sent it arrived in a semi-orderly fashion, hurrah! We knew the printer, leads and circuitry worked, but why didn&#8217;t it work on the other network?</p>

<p>The next day the magic serial-USB debugging lead arrived and it was time to download the Arduino app and work out what on earth was happening. Once hooked up, the little bundle of electronic joy started telling us debug messages from the sketch.. which was nice, but it still didn&#8217;t work. Time for some coding I thought.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think you can actually see what code is being run on the device as it is compiled in to assembler, so all I could do was add some further debugging information and upload it. I had some theories about the network too, what would happen if I put in the explicit IP address? Tweaked the URL it was using? Nothing, still didn&#8217;t work. At this point I thought we may was well upload the <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/blob/master/printer.ino">original sketch</a> with the relevant bits tweeted&#8230;</p>

<p>AND IT ONLY WENT AND WORKED!</p>

<p>Heathcliff lives&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/heathcliff31-620x620.jpg" alt="Heathcliff Lives" /></p>

<p>and after lunch, we got Cathy working too!</p>

<p>Next week we&#8217;ll send them off to Wuthering Heights and see what happens..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re three days in to our residency and time is already flying along. We&#8217;ve spoken to a lot of people, fixed some niggly problems in the office and had some ideas which I&#8217;m sure any Technologist in Residence would be proud of!</p>

<p>Our esteemed directors at Site have been storing up interesting people for us to talk to which has been great. It&#8217;s striking how we&#8217;ve met people who are passionate, not only about what they do, but about the greater tech community in Sheffield, Sheffield itself, Yorkshire and the North! This resonates with me as a Yorkshirebod and as someone who would like to see the economic balance tip in our direction.</p>

<p>Site have a new Technical expert starting at the beginning of May so there is a small backlog of  outstanding techie issues for the organisation. I find it impossible to sit in the office without diving in to help when the printer doesn&#8217;t work or the wi-fi has gone screwy! Hopefully now we&#8217;ve fixed some of the more pressing issues but it is highlighted for me that I have to be careful with my time. We had decided that we would spend three days a week on-site in the office but actually it makes sense to spend a day elsewhere to allow us to focus on bigger tasks without interruption. We&#8217;ll try that next week to see how we go.</p>

<p>Our bigger ideas are still fermenting, but two <a href="http://arduino.cc/hu/Guide/Introduction">Arduino</a> kits arrived on Friday and as it is about 25 years since I last played with electronics in anger, I&#8217;m excited to see what we end up using them for. I think I had something like this when I was a kid&#8230; you should have heard the stylophone I made!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sheffield is the city of Seven Hills, George Orwell wrote in &#8216;Road to Wigan Pier&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The town is very hilly (said to be built on seven hills, like Rome) and everywhere streets of mean little houses blackened by smoke run up at sharp angles, paved with cobbles which are purposely set unevenly to give horses etc, a grip&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We don&#8217;t have many horses heading up and down hills any more, nor are our houses mean, but it does feel like we are missing a bit of a trick. The city centre has its ups and downs, steps, ramps and in one particular office block, a slide..</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=twA_mVMgMY8</p>

<p>So if an office building can have that, how about a slide in some other parts of the city. At this point I should fire up a photo editing app with a picture of the site in the city and overlay an amazing &#8216;artist&#8217;s impression&#8217; of a slide. Maybe I&#8217;ll do that another time. For now though, here is an example of some outdoor thinking in the Netherlands at an entrance to a railway station in Utrecht</p>

<p>http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1uurSegIH4</p>

<p>This is what we want, some super duper slides installed, imagine what an economic edge it would give to Sheffield!</p>

<p>In the mean time, until we do get more slides, here is one way of getting down an escalator in a hurry&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last summer, when I set up my own company, ShedCode, I was fortunate to be able share an office with 3 friends, all of whom I&#8217;d worked with before. We were able to get an office on the top floor of the Site Gallery building, so my relationship with Site was already established on a different footing, that of a happy tenant.</p>

<p>That is not to say that I had any real idea what happened in the building! Sure, there was a cafe and a shop, but I was not that familiar with the rest of the space, the actual gallery. I&#8217;d have a look at each new exhibition, but it was usually a quick zoom around whilst waiting for a coffee.</p>

<p>Fast forward to this week, Tuesday 27th March 2012, when the Happenstance induction began and ignorance would no longer be an excuse! Leila (my co-technologist-in-residence) &amp; I spent a couple of days finding out much more about our place of work for the 10 weeks. We had many chats with the two directors, Laura Sillars and Judith Harry, sat in a staff meeting, had a tour around the secret rooms of the gallery, unearthed old AV kit, basked in the sun on one of the balconies, met our amazing mentor, James Boardwell, met our friendly researcher, Chris Bilton, went to our fantastic local pub, The Rutland Arms and visited some of the art spaces within a 10 minute walk of the Site.</p>

<p>Now we have a much better idea of where Site Gallery sits in relation to the city of Sheffield, the UK and Internationally. The gallery is located a few minutes from the Railway Station, in the middle of a real creative area of the city. Apparently there are over 300 studio spaces within 10 minutes walk! We were fortunate to be able to have a sneak peak in some of these places, Yorkshire Art Space, Access Space, the Archipelago Works, Bloc and S1 Artspace. Many of these buildings I would walk past each day on the way to work, without realising that behind the walls, doors and windows, incredible things were taking place.</p>

<p>As for Happenstance, well, I&#8217;m looking forward to working with Leila, we have different, yet hopefully, complementary skill sets and I feel I have a lot to learn from her. We&#8217;ve discussed some of the challenges that appeal to problem solving techies and we have a few ideas which we&#8217;ll be looking to explore further when we start officially after Easter. The Gallery itself has recently been going through a period of organisational and strategic change. Laura and Judith have been able to look, with fresh eyes, at the potential for growth of the organisation and it&#8217;s role as a connector within the city. I hope we can help!</p>

<p>The first <em>real</em> impression I remember being able to do was Windy Miller from Camberwick Green. Well actually, it was Windy Miller&#8217;s windmill, but you know what I mean&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really chuffed to say that I&#8217;ve been successful in applying for a residency with the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project</a>. When I first heard about it, I thought it sounded interesting but, I didn&#8217;t consider my chances of getting a place were very high.</p>

<p>Filling in the application form was a great way to help me think through what I could offer and also helped me to realise that it was exactly the sort of thing I should try with my new found freelance freedom. So, some time later, I submitted the form to see what would happen. In all I think 60 odd people applied, so I was excited to find that I&#8217;d been invited to the sandpit day at <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/">NESTA</a> (The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts) for a selection workshop and interview.</p>

<p>The day came and I zipped down to the big smoke on the train. Candidates were seen 6 at a time and my group including some strong candidates, including <a href="http://finalbullet.com">Leila Johnston</a> who will be my partner in crime for the project up at <a href="http://sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> in sunny Sheffield.</p>

<p>After all that, I was offered a place, hurrah!</p>

<p>So you may ask what I&#8217;ll be doing - well, that&#8217;s a very good question. From the project site:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a resident, you will be expected to:</p>

<h3>Complete Two Projects</h3>

<p><em>The main body of the residencies will be split into two short five-week sprints. Each resident, or pair of residents, will complete one small project or one prototype in each sprint. The first project will be based upon the idea that you submit in your application, which will be further refined during the Sandpit Day in February; the second will be based upon your observations while resident in the organisation.</em></p>

<h3>Share Your Work</h3>

<p><em>You will be asked to document your work on a weekly basis, via a project blog, and also participate in three ‘Open House’ events, where you will have the opportunity to present your work, talk through your process and discuss any wider themes or implications. During the residencies, you will have the opportunity to work with both a mentor and a project manager.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>My fellow Technologist In Residence, Leila, has written a good blog post about the kind of stuff we may end up doing. <a href="http://finalbullet.com/2012/03/10/im-going-to-sheffield/">Deffo worth a read</a>!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully blog and tweet as I go with the project, as well as the official blog posts which will be part of my &#8216;write up&#8217; - not sure where that will be yet!</p>

<p>Hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A client got in touch with a weird problem, when logging in to flickr, some images wouldn&#8217;t download, the placeholders would be there with the classic little red cross indicating a problem.</p>

<h3>Idea 1 - funny URLs</h3>

<p>Thinking that something must be going wrong with the content delivery for those pictures, the farm was down or whatever, I asked him to send through the direct URL, plus to try accessing it himself. Well, usually it didn&#8217;t work, but sometimes, if he right clicked and asked the browser to download the image it did. Curious.</p>

<h3>Idea 2 - browsers</h3>

<p>Ok, well, maybe it&#8217;s just the browser messing up with its security levels. Nope, still the same on Safari, Chrome &amp; Firefox.</p>

<h3>Idea 3 - DNS</h3>

<p>Maybe the DNS is being bodged up for those server farms. Try google DNS - no joy. Try flushing Windows DNS cache - no joy.</p>

<h3>Idea 4 - Firefox&#8217;s exception list</h3>

<p>This is where I found out about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/test">Flickr&#8217;s test page </a> which is useful for trouble shooting this stuff. Apparently all the global column didn&#8217;t load on a clean firefox install. So we added farm1 to firefox&#8217;s image exception list. Boom, they all came back.. bizarre.</p>

<h3>Idea 5 - Conflict with security software</h3>

<p>The machine was XP SP 3 with AVG internet security installed. After a further prod around, Ad-aware was on there, as was McAfee. So, here&#8217;s an idea, boot in to safe mode with networking and see if that works&#8230; Hmm, nope.</p>

<h3>Idea 6 - Must be unrelated to the computer, belkin router anyone?</h3>

<p>Surely the ISP wouldn&#8217;t be messing about here&#8230; but what about the router. A belkin apparently, which is when I found a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/72157627085259789/">flickr forum thread</a> of people with the same problem. Ah, belkin routers - this is starting to make sense. Believe it or not, switching off the router firewall (whilst maintaining a software firewall on the PC) meant that the images downloaded without a problem. Argh! It was the router all along. It seemed so obscure.</p>

<h3>In a nutshell</h3>

<p>If you are having problems with flickr (or other image intensive sites) and you have a belkin router with the firewall switched on. SWITCH it off and see if it fixes it. If it does - bingo!</p>

<p>If you have Table A, with column 1, 2, 3 and Table B with columns 4, 5, 6 – Primary keys are columns 1 &amp; 4 respectively.</p>

<p>Now you want to add a foreign key to table B, column 6, referencing column 1 in table A. No problem:</p>

<p><code>ALTER TABLE tableB ADD CONSTRAINT fk_column_1 FOREIGN KEY (column6) REFERENCES tableA (column1);</code></p>

<p>oh dear, fails with something like</p>

<p><code>ERROR 1005 (HY000): Can't create table './databasename/#sql-55d1_b07.frm' (errno: 150)</code></p>

<p>This fails because creating the primary key on columns 1 and 4 don’t automatically create indexes on those columns, and adding a foreign key requires there to be an index on the column you are referencing. Boom!</p>
