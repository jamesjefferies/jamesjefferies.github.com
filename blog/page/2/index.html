  <div class="entry-content"><p>Oh dear, what happened to week 7, 8 blog posts (I hear you ask)?</p>

<p>Good question. Here&#8217;s a little re-cap of what you missed (thanks <a href="http://offbott.com/">offbott</a> for the reminders!)</p>

<h3>Week 7</h3>

<p>This week was mainly taken up with:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>creating a test version of the site gallery website, so that we could have a good tinker with the layout</p></li>
<li><p>investigating the building&#8217;s network wiring and working out how we could get the office in to a better shape</p></li>
<li><p>an official rehearsal for our TedX Sheffield talk</p></li>
</ul>


<h3>Week 8 - the broken back week</h3>

<p>I really kernackered my back on Wednesday morning, which meant that I ended up working a bit on .. ahem.. Cathy &amp; Heathcliff&#8217;s back ends from home. Thursday was a bit better and we came up with the idea of building a &#8216;who&#8217;s in the house&#8217; lighting board. Leila has been doing lots of soldering. Our IP camera arrived on Friday and we had it looking around the office with it&#8217;s spooky eye.</p>

<h3>Week 9 - the TedX and Sheffield Doc/Fest Week</h3>

<p>Tuesday was Sheffield TedX and we were invited to do a 10 minute talk as part of the whole shebang. We managed to get Heathcliff working by borrowing a MacMini from Site, getting it to pick up the Wi-fi in the Crucible (yes, THAT crucible in Sheffield) and share it&#8217;s ethernet connection. Attendees could then send SMS to Heathcliff and up in the refreshment area, he&#8217;s print out their messages.</p>

<p>We weren&#8217;t in the main part of the Crucible, but the Crucible studio which has room for about 270 people. I will confess and say that I felt the pressure for this one. Speaking in front of 270 people is one thing, being filmed ready for the TedX channel on YouTube is something else again!</p>

<p>I think we did ok and people had nice things to say about us. Hurrah! The other speakers were, in the main, fantastic! Inspiring stuff.</p>

<p>Then, Wednesday was the <a href="http://www.xolabs.co.uk/2011/11/01/xo-summit-expo-2012/">XO Summit</a> as part of Doc/Fest, which I managed to&#8230; errr, attend. Bumped in to and had a chat with the Right Honourable Honor Harger and caught up with some people I&#8217;d met the day before.</p>

<p>Thursday was more Cathy &amp; Heathcliff re-writing. Getting rid of the awful PHP which we&#8217;d used initially and the gmail to ifttt to twitter thing and replacing it with a bit of Ruby and Sinatra which I got running on Heroku (was it any co-incidence that Heroku had a major outage overnight afterwards? I hope so!)</p>

<p>Then today.. blogging ahoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3>Then</h3>

<p>This time last year I was in despair, I wasn’t enjoying my job and it was getting me down. Up to that point I’d spent 6 years writing software for Barclays, 5 years writing software for npower/Yorkshire Electricity, 3 years writing software for the digital agency Technophobia. I could feel myself getting stale and much as I enjoyed working with a lot of my colleagues, it felt to me like I needed a bit of a change.</p>

<p>During August 2011, I left <a href="http://www.technophobia.com">Technophobia</a> and set up my own limited company ShedCode without much of an idea what to do next! Fortunately I was able to get off with a cracking start; I was able to share an office above the <a href="http://www.sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> in Sheffield City Centre with 3 good friends and then I was able to do some standard contracting work, 4 days a week to get some funds in the coffers.</p>

<p>Having an office was key to me going freelance, I didn’t really want to work from home, too many distractions, but sharing a small office with people I like and can trust was ideal. Being at tenant at Site also meant that I started to meet people in the building, both staff &amp; other tenants. It’s a great place to work &amp; it’s also where I first heard about the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project.</a> In a nutshell, the project is a 10 week residency for technologists in Arts Organisations of which Site was to be one of them.</p>

<h2>Happenstance</h2>

<p>After umming and ahhing a bit about applying, I decided to go for it, the weekend before the deadline. The actual application process was really useful for me, helping me to work out some ideas about what I wanted to do next, with my career and ShedCode. To cut a long story short, I managed to get a place as one of the residents and at the point of writing this, we’re 7 weeks into the 10 weeks.</p>

<p>Time really flies when you’re having fun and learning new things and so far that sums the residency up nicely. We’ve built thermal printing sentient characters from Wuthering Heights which are mobile, tweet and respond to SMS text messages. An incredible polargraph drawing machine as well as fixing lots of technical things for the Site organisation itself. You can read more about what we’ve been up to on the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com/blog">happenstance project blog</a> and our <a href="http://happenstancesheffield.tumblr.com/">tumblr </a>site.</p>

<p>I’ve hankered after Research &amp; Development time for years and getting the odd day here or there hasn’t been enough. This residency though has been a mixture of R&amp;D and practical help for the organisation and it has seriously got me thinking. It’s one thing to have an idea, it’s something else though to have the time to actually try and get it to work. There have been nights after working on happenstance when I have not been able to sleep as my brain has been working overtime trying to solve problems&#8230; I feel a bit more alive!</p>

<p>The question now though for me, is</p>

<h2>Whatever next?</h2>

<p>I’m pretty good, if I can blow my own trumpet for a minute, at technical problem solving. From laser printers, to wireless networks, to security, to domains, even WordPress. As a problem solver and nosy chuffer, you don’t spend 17 years working without picking up some knowledge of what your colleagues do!</p>

<p>I’ve spent most of my time though writing and designing software. I’m not the best software engineer in the world, in fact there’s a lot of my code out there which other people now have to support for which I apologise most sincerely, but I’m not a bad all rounder.</p>

<p>Once Happenstance finishes, at the end of June, I’d like to take some time to work on some of my own projects. I’ve got two railway related products I’d like to build, plus a project for school kids and then at least one other one which is coming together.</p>

<p>Since being a Technologist in Residence though, it’s given me the hunger to get involved in other things too. It’s been a real privilege working with my fellow resident <a href="http://finalbullet.com">Leila Johnston</a>, she is a great writer, inventor and organiser of exciting events and has an incredible network of interesting people who do really interesting things.</p>

<p>And as I wrote that sentence above, it’s when I thought, hang on, that’s what I’m after. I think I WANT TO BE AN INTERESTING PERSON! So that people can say, &#8220;Hey, you know who you should get in to do such and such, you could do a lot worse than hire that friendly freelancer James Jefferies!&#8221;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Leila has done a top job of writing up about the Open House we held at Site Gallery on Friday. We had a great time talking about Happenstance so far to a full house (well cafe anyway).</p>

<p><a href="http://jamesjefferies.com/?attachment_id=551"><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/settingupopenhouse-620x465.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Having the Polargraph finally up and running on the correct voltage was great and a fantastic drawing of Lord Jarvis of Cocker appeared as the event went on.</p>

<p>We also had Heathcliff Printer working (although he did conk out at one point for some unexplained reason) and Leila got her Kinnect set up doing some Minority Report style magic.</p>

<p>One of our conductive <a href="http://www.bareconductive.com/paper-houses">paint houses</a> was there too, but it was too dark really to see it in action. Winter time for those I think.</p>

<p>We had a little Q&amp;A after our talk and one of the questions really got me thinking about being a creative software engineer - what does that mean in practice and how can we encourage techies to embrace their creativity, smashing through the constraints of institutional methodologies. Sounds like that might be a future blog post!</p>

<p>A lot of cake was eaten and a good time was had by all. Thanks to all who helped and all who came along!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The final week of Sprint 1 was all a bit of a blur. As we had the Future Everything conference on the Friday, my thoughts were on the presentation.</p>

<p>We also did some work on our <a href="http://polargraph.co.uk">Polargraph</a> which was not behaving very well at all. This was disappointing as we&#8217;d hope to get it working before Future Everything. What was cool though, was that we saw some Polargraphs in action at the conference, Stuart Childs and Matt Venn had their super machines in action. Matt is doing stuff with <a href="http://www.mattvenn.net/2011/09/19/polargraph-energy-monitoring/">Energy Monitoring</a></p>

<p>The Manchester Museum of Science and Industry is a great place, I especially enjoyed looking at the big steam engines and railway engines in the Power Hall. Took my mind of our talk which went OK! It was fun to see Linda and Natalia our fellow residents from Bristol and Brighton galleries respectively.</p>

<p>.. and relax! (Chris the researcher, me and Natalia looking interested.. I think!)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week has been a bit wonky.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday</strong> was a triumph, getting Cathy and Heathcliff doing something useful as part of Bill Drummond&#8217;s sixth form workshop. It certainly warmed the cockles &amp; Leila has written some more about it on her post.</p>

<p><strong>Tuesday</strong> was a day where we were part of Site&#8217;s Brand Innovation task force, looking at Site&#8217;s &#8216;Brand Promise&#8217;. This was jam packed and a bit of a brain strain, but we made a contribution and as we were observed by our illustrious researcher, we hopefully gave him something to write about!</p>

<p><strong>Wednesday</strong> went a bit wonky as my daughter was poorly meaning the day was very broken up. I started having a look at Ruby, the programming language whilst thinking about how we could get Cathy &amp; Heathcliff to interact a bit more with Twitter.</p>

<p><strong>Thursday</strong> was the day of working out how to get Cathy and Heathcliff mobile. A frustrating day as the components and bits and bobs we bought didn&#8217;t work or wouldn&#8217;t work how we wanted them to. We ended the day though with a 3G dongle and an ethernet to USB connector which hopefully means that if we can take a Mac, a dongle, a lead, a printer &amp; some sort of power supply then we can take them anywhere where there is a mobile signal and they&#8217;ll work.</p>

<p>We also spent a fair bit of time thinking about our contribution to <a href="http://futureeverything.org/">Future Everything</a> which is next week, meep!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week has given us a real opportunity to do something interesting with Cathy &amp; Heathcliff, we spent two of our three days out of the Site office to get our heads down.</p>

<p>The first challenge was to allow 6th Formers to send messages to Cathy &amp; Heathcliff. At first we thought of hooking them up directly to twitter accounts, but as Leila had a <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> account, it meant that we could do something clever with SMS Text messages. With a bit of PHP magic on an intermediary server (timescales demanded a quick turnaround!) we managed to get the SMS messages sent to the two printers. Hooray!</p>

<p>The next step was to bypass the button on the Arduino device which you had to push each time a message arrived. We edited the C code and uploaded the new code to the devices so that instead of waiting for the button to be pushed, the green light flashed and it printed without intervention. Hooray x 2!</p>

<p>Finally, we wanted to get the messages sent to Cathy and Heathcliff&#8217;s twitter accounts - @CathyPrinter @HeathcliffPrinter - initially we looked a using the PHP OAuth libraries to authenticate and send the message to twitter, but as neither of us are particularly adept at PHP, we decided on a different solution. Using <a href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That</a> and some server side magic, we send an email from the server, via their gmail accounts to If This Then That, which then passes them on to their twitter accounts.. Hooray x 3!</p>

<p>You can see us setting them up on our <a href="http://happenstancesheffield.tumblr.com">tumblr site</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This week has all been about pairs of trousers. It has rained a lot and usually when you are equidistant from where you are going and where you want to go, the heavens open and you get absolutely soaked. I&#8217;ve been through three pairs of trousers and counting.</p>

<p><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/rain-620x620.jpg" alt="rain" /></p>

<p>So trousers.. and marketing/branding innovation labs, meeting with yet more interesting people, fixing the internet and eating flapjack.</p>

<p>To distract us from the weather and all these other things we&#8217;ve had the excitement of two receipt printers which we are bringing to life. The illustrious <a href="http://twitter.com/lazyatom">James Adam</a> has written a fantastic <a href="http://gofreerange.com/hello-printer">article</a> about how to build internet enabled receipt printers. My advice would be to go away and read that, when you&#8217;re done, come back here!</p>

<p>So we have been guinea pigs, taking delivery of two printers complete with special <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">arduino</a> kits, leads and other <a href="http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Gubbins">gubbins</a>. Of course, all we needed to do was plug them in (following the instructions) and BOOM! The little printers would burst in to life&#8230;.</p>

<p><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/heathcliff12-463x620.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>&#8230; except they did not :(</p>

<p>The little light flashed to say that it was talking to the internet, but the internet didn&#8217;t want to speak back. This was a blow, was it the printer, was it the lead, was it the network, was it the circuitry, was it the &#8216;sketch&#8217; (the arduino program)? So we put on our best Worzel Gummidge problem solving heads and got to work. We broke in to the server room and tried a direct connection (rather than through all the office switches and routers), fired up skype and waved the laptop in the direction of the kit whilst the illustrious one watched from afar. No joy.</p>

<p>We knew that one of the other tenants in the building used a different internet connection, so we took one of the printers up there and plugged it in. It burst into life and the backlog of messages we&#8217;d sent it arrived in a semi-orderly fashion, hurrah! We knew the printer, leads and circuitry worked, but why didn&#8217;t it work on the other network?</p>

<p>The next day the magic serial-USB debugging lead arrived and it was time to download the Arduino app and work out what on earth was happening. Once hooked up, the little bundle of electronic joy started telling us debug messages from the sketch.. which was nice, but it still didn&#8217;t work. Time for some coding I thought.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think you can actually see what code is being run on the device as it is compiled in to assembler, so all I could do was add some further debugging information and upload it. I had some theories about the network too, what would happen if I put in the explicit IP address? Tweaked the URL it was using? Nothing, still didn&#8217;t work. At this point I thought we may was well upload the <a href="https://github.com/freerange/printer/blob/master/printer.ino">original sketch</a> with the relevant bits tweeted&#8230;</p>

<p>AND IT ONLY WENT AND WORKED!</p>

<p>Heathcliff lives&#8230;</p>

<p><img src="http://happenstanceproject.com/assets/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/heathcliff31-620x620.jpg" alt="Heathcliff Lives" /></p>

<p>and after lunch, we got Cathy working too!</p>

<p>Next week we&#8217;ll send them off to Wuthering Heights and see what happens..</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&#8217;re three days in to our residency and time is already flying along. We&#8217;ve spoken to a lot of people, fixed some niggly problems in the office and had some ideas which I&#8217;m sure any Technologist in Residence would be proud of!</p>

<p>Our esteemed directors at Site have been storing up interesting people for us to talk to which has been great. It&#8217;s striking how we&#8217;ve met people who are passionate, not only about what they do, but about the greater tech community in Sheffield, Sheffield itself, Yorkshire and the North! This resonates with me as a Yorkshirebod and as someone who would like to see the economic balance tip in our direction.</p>

<p>Site have a new Technical expert starting at the beginning of May so there is a small backlog of  outstanding techie issues for the organisation. I find it impossible to sit in the office without diving in to help when the printer doesn&#8217;t work or the wi-fi has gone screwy! Hopefully now we&#8217;ve fixed some of the more pressing issues but it is highlighted for me that I have to be careful with my time. We had decided that we would spend three days a week on-site in the office but actually it makes sense to spend a day elsewhere to allow us to focus on bigger tasks without interruption. We&#8217;ll try that next week to see how we go.</p>

<p>Our bigger ideas are still fermenting, but two <a href="http://arduino.cc/hu/Guide/Introduction">Arduino</a> kits arrived on Friday and as it is about 25 years since I last played with electronics in anger, I&#8217;m excited to see what we end up using them for. I think I had something like this when I was a kid&#8230; you should have heard the stylophone I made!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sheffield is the city of Seven Hills, George Orwell wrote in &#8216;Road to Wigan Pier&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The town is very hilly (said to be built on seven hills, like Rome) and everywhere streets of mean little houses blackened by smoke run up at sharp angles, paved with cobbles which are purposely set unevenly to give horses etc, a grip&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We don&#8217;t have many horses heading up and down hills any more, nor are our houses mean, but it does feel like we are missing a bit of a trick. The city centre has its ups and downs, steps, ramps and in one particular office block, a slide..</p>

<p>So if an office building can have that, how about a slide in some other parts of the city. At this point I should fire up a photo editing app with a picture of the site in the city and overlay an amazing &#8216;artist&#8217;s impression&#8217; of a slide. Maybe I&#8217;ll do that another time. For now though, here is an example of some outdoor thinking in the Netherlands at an entrance to a railway station in Utrecht</p>

<p>This is what we want, some super duper slides installed, imagine what an economic edge it would give to Sheffield!</p>

<p>In the mean time, until we do get more slides, here is one way of getting down an escalator in a hurry&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last summer, when I set up my own company, ShedCode, I was fortunate to be able share an office with 3 friends, all of whom I&#8217;d worked with before. We were able to get an office on the top floor of the Site Gallery building, so my relationship with Site was already established on a different footing, that of a happy tenant.</p>

<p>That is not to say that I had any real idea what happened in the building! Sure, there was a cafe and a shop, but I was not that familiar with the rest of the space, the actual gallery. I&#8217;d have a look at each new exhibition, but it was usually a quick zoom around whilst waiting for a coffee.</p>

<p>Fast forward to this week, Tuesday 27th March 2012, when the Happenstance induction began and ignorance would no longer be an excuse! Leila (my co-technologist-in-residence) &amp; I spent a couple of days finding out much more about our place of work for the 10 weeks. We had many chats with the two directors, Laura Sillars and Judith Harry, sat in a staff meeting, had a tour around the secret rooms of the gallery, unearthed old AV kit, basked in the sun on one of the balconies, met our amazing mentor, James Boardwell, met our friendly researcher, Chris Bilton, went to our fantastic local pub, The Rutland Arms and visited some of the art spaces within a 10 minute walk of the Site.</p>

<p>Now we have a much better idea of where Site Gallery sits in relation to the city of Sheffield, the UK and Internationally. The gallery is located a few minutes from the Railway Station, in the middle of a real creative area of the city. Apparently there are over 300 studio spaces within 10 minutes walk! We were fortunate to be able to have a sneak peak in some of these places, Yorkshire Art Space, Access Space, the Archipelago Works, Bloc and S1 Artspace. Many of these buildings I would walk past each day on the way to work, without realising that behind the walls, doors and windows, incredible things were taking place.</p>

<p>As for Happenstance, well, I&#8217;m looking forward to working with Leila, we have different, yet hopefully, complementary skill sets and I feel I have a lot to learn from her. We&#8217;ve discussed some of the challenges that appeal to problem solving techies and we have a few ideas which we&#8217;ll be looking to explore further when we start officially after Easter. The Gallery itself has recently been going through a period of organisational and strategic change. Laura and Judith have been able to look, with fresh eyes, at the potential for growth of the organisation and it&#8217;s role as a connector within the city. I hope we can help!</p>

<p>The first <em>real</em> impression I remember being able to do was Windy Miller from Camberwick Green. Well actually, it was Windy Miller&#8217;s windmill, but you know what I mean&#8230;</p>
