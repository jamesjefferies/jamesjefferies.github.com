  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sheffield is the city of Seven Hills, George Orwell wrote in &#8216;Road to Wigan Pier&#8217;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;The town is very hilly (said to be built on seven hills, like Rome) and everywhere streets of mean little houses blackened by smoke run up at sharp angles, paved with cobbles which are purposely set unevenly to give horses etc, a grip&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>We don&#8217;t have many horses heading up and down hills any more, nor are our houses mean, but it does feel like we are missing a bit of a trick. The city centre has its ups and downs, steps, ramps and in one particular office block, a slide..</p>

<p>So if an office building can have that, how about a slide in some other parts of the city. At this point I should fire up a photo editing app with a picture of the site in the city and overlay an amazing &#8216;artist&#8217;s impression&#8217; of a slide. Maybe I&#8217;ll do that another time. For now though, here is an example of some outdoor thinking in the Netherlands at an entrance to a railway station in Utrecht</p>

<p>This is what we want, some super duper slides installed, imagine what an economic edge it would give to Sheffield!</p>

<p>In the mean time, until we do get more slides, here is one way of getting down an escalator in a hurry&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last summer, when I set up my own company, ShedCode, I was fortunate to be able share an office with 3 friends, all of whom I&#8217;d worked with before. We were able to get an office on the top floor of the Site Gallery building, so my relationship with Site was already established on a different footing, that of a happy tenant.</p>

<p>That is not to say that I had any real idea what happened in the building! Sure, there was a cafe and a shop, but I was not that familiar with the rest of the space, the actual gallery. I&#8217;d have a look at each new exhibition, but it was usually a quick zoom around whilst waiting for a coffee.</p>

<p>Fast forward to this week, Tuesday 27th March 2012, when the Happenstance induction began and ignorance would no longer be an excuse! Leila (my co-technologist-in-residence) &amp; I spent a couple of days finding out much more about our place of work for the 10 weeks. We had many chats with the two directors, Laura Sillars and Judith Harry, sat in a staff meeting, had a tour around the secret rooms of the gallery, unearthed old AV kit, basked in the sun on one of the balconies, met our amazing mentor, James Boardwell, met our friendly researcher, Chris Bilton, went to our fantastic local pub, The Rutland Arms and visited some of the art spaces within a 10 minute walk of the Site.</p>

<p>Now we have a much better idea of where Site Gallery sits in relation to the city of Sheffield, the UK and Internationally. The gallery is located a few minutes from the Railway Station, in the middle of a real creative area of the city. Apparently there are over 300 studio spaces within 10 minutes walk! We were fortunate to be able to have a sneak peak in some of these places, Yorkshire Art Space, Access Space, the Archipelago Works, Bloc and S1 Artspace. Many of these buildings I would walk past each day on the way to work, without realising that behind the walls, doors and windows, incredible things were taking place.</p>

<p>As for Happenstance, well, I&#8217;m looking forward to working with Leila, we have different, yet hopefully, complementary skill sets and I feel I have a lot to learn from her. We&#8217;ve discussed some of the challenges that appeal to problem solving techies and we have a few ideas which we&#8217;ll be looking to explore further when we start officially after Easter. The Gallery itself has recently been going through a period of organisational and strategic change. Laura and Judith have been able to look, with fresh eyes, at the potential for growth of the organisation and it&#8217;s role as a connector within the city. I hope we can help!</p>

<p>The first <em>real</em> impression I remember being able to do was Windy Miller from Camberwick Green. Well actually, it was Windy Miller&#8217;s windmill, but you know what I mean&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really chuffed to say that I&#8217;ve been successful in applying for a residency with the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project</a>. When I first heard about it, I thought it sounded interesting but, I didn&#8217;t consider my chances of getting a place were very high.</p>

<p>Filling in the application form was a great way to help me think through what I could offer and also helped me to realise that it was exactly the sort of thing I should try with my new found freelance freedom. So, some time later, I submitted the form to see what would happen. In all I think 60 odd people applied, so I was excited to find that I&#8217;d been invited to the sandpit day at <a href="http://www.nesta.org.uk/">NESTA</a> (The National Endowment for Science, Technology and the Arts) for a selection workshop and interview.</p>

<p>The day came and I zipped down to the big smoke on the train. Candidates were seen 6 at a time and my group including some strong candidates, including <a href="http://finalbullet.com">Leila Johnston</a> who will be my partner in crime for the project up at <a href="http://sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> in sunny Sheffield.</p>

<p>After all that, I was offered a place, hurrah!</p>

<p>So you may ask what I&#8217;ll be doing - well, that&#8217;s a very good question. From the project site:</p>

<blockquote><p>As a resident, you will be expected to:</p>

<h3>Complete Two Projects</h3>

<p><em>The main body of the residencies will be split into two short five-week sprints. Each resident, or pair of residents, will complete one small project or one prototype in each sprint. The first project will be based upon the idea that you submit in your application, which will be further refined during the Sandpit Day in February; the second will be based upon your observations while resident in the organisation.</em></p>

<h3>Share Your Work</h3>

<p><em>You will be asked to document your work on a weekly basis, via a project blog, and also participate in three ‘Open House’ events, where you will have the opportunity to present your work, talk through your process and discuss any wider themes or implications. During the residencies, you will have the opportunity to work with both a mentor and a project manager.</em></p></blockquote>

<p>My fellow Technologist In Residence, Leila, has written a good blog post about the kind of stuff we may end up doing. <a href="http://finalbullet.com/2012/03/10/im-going-to-sheffield/">Deffo worth a read</a>!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll hopefully blog and tweet as I go with the project, as well as the official blog posts which will be part of my &#8216;write up&#8217; - not sure where that will be yet!</p>

<p>Hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Unity eh? Love it or hate it the version in Ubuntu 11.04 seems not quite complete. Also other applications sometimes will not play nicely.</p>

<p>Eclipse is one of them, your menu items can go walk about. I found this <a href="http://blog.matto1990.com/2011/04/using-eclipse-under-ubuntu-11-04-natty/">blog post</a> which has a helpful hint. Unsetting UBUNTU_MENUPROXY for the application does the trick</p>

<pre><code>#!/bin/bash

  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;re running Liquibase, configured by Spring (or whatever) and you don&#8217;t want it to run it&#8217;s checks when running unit tests, you can disable it from running by setting a system property.</p>

<p>Whilst running a single unit test class many times, you might want to add a system set property call before any of the tests are run. Hence:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A client got in touch with a weird problem, when logging in to flickr, some images wouldn&#8217;t download, the placeholders would be there with the classic little red cross indicating a problem.</p>

<h3>Idea 1 - funny URLs</h3>

<p>Thinking that something must be going wrong with the content delivery for those pictures, the farm was down or whatever, I asked him to send through the direct URL, plus to try accessing it himself. Well, usually it didn&#8217;t work, but sometimes, if he right clicked and asked the browser to download the image it did. Curious.</p>

<h3>Idea 2 - browsers</h3>

<p>Ok, well, maybe it&#8217;s just the browser messing up with its security levels. Nope, still the same on Safari, Chrome &amp; Firefox.</p>

<h3>Idea 3 - DNS</h3>

<p>Maybe the DNS is being bodged up for those server farms. Try google DNS - no joy. Try flushing Windows DNS cache - no joy.</p>

<h3>Idea 4 - Firefox&#8217;s exception list</h3>

<p>This is where I found out about <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/test">Flickr&#8217;s test page </a> which is useful for trouble shooting this stuff. Apparently all the global column didn&#8217;t load on a clean firefox install. So we added farm1 to firefox&#8217;s image exception list. Boom, they all came back.. bizarre.</p>

<h3>Idea 5 - Conflict with security software</h3>

<p>The machine was XP SP 3 with AVG internet security installed. After a further prod around, Ad-aware was on there, as was McAfee. So, here&#8217;s an idea, boot in to safe mode with networking and see if that works&#8230; Hmm, nope.</p>

<h3>Idea 6 - Must be unrelated to the computer, belkin router anyone?</h3>

<p>Surely the ISP wouldn&#8217;t be messing about here&#8230; but what about the router. A belkin apparently, which is when I found a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/help/forum/72157627085259789/">flickr forum thread</a> of people with the same problem. Ah, belkin routers - this is starting to make sense. Believe it or not, switching off the router firewall (whilst maintaining a software firewall on the PC) meant that the images downloaded without a problem. Argh! It was the router all along. It seemed so obscure.</p>

<h3>In a nutshell</h3>

<p>If you are having problems with flickr (or other image intensive sites) and you have a belkin router with the firewall switched on. SWITCH it off and see if it fixes it. If it does - bingo!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is to remind me next time that MySQL isn’t as clever as you think it might be.</p>

<p>If you have Table A, with column 1, 2, 3 and Table B with columns 4, 5, 6 – Primary keys are columns 1 &amp; 4 respectively.</p>

<p>Now you want to add a foreign key to table B, column 6, referencing column 1 in table A. No problem:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="o">`</span><span class="k">ALTER</span> <span class="k">TABLE</span> <span class="n">tableB</span> <span class="k">ADD</span> <span class="k">CONSTRAINT</span> <span class="n">fk_column_1</span> <span class="k">FOREIGN</span> <span class="k">KEY</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">column6</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="k">REFERENCES</span> <span class="n">tableA</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">column1</span><span class="p">);</span><span class="o">`</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>oh dear, fails with something like</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sql'><span class='line'><span class="o">`</span><span class="n">ERROR</span> <span class="mi">1005</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">HY000</span><span class="p">):</span> <span class="n">Can</span><span class="s1">&#39;t create table &#39;</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">databasename</span><span class="o">/#</span><span class="k">sql</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="mi">55</span><span class="n">d1_b07</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">frm</span><span class="err">&#39;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">errno</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">150</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">`</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>This fails because creating the primary key on columns 1 and 4 don’t automatically create indexes on those columns, and adding a foreign key requires there to be an index on the column you are referencing. Boom!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Scala is a relatively new programming language, which runs on the Java Virtual Machine and has very good interoperability with the Java Language.</p>

<p>Here is the blurb from <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">the official site</a></p>

<p>&#8220;Scala is a general purpose programming language designed to express common programming patterns in a concise, elegant, and type-safe way. It smoothly integrates features of object-oriented and functional languages, enabling Java and other programmers to be more productive. Code sizes are typically reduced by a factor of two to three when compared to an equivalent Java application.&#8221;</p>

<p>The bit which gets managers excited is the bit where it says &#8220;more productive&#8221;, the bit which gets technical architects excited is the bit where it says &#8220;smoothly integrates&#8221; and the bits which get developers excited is all of it!</p>

<p>Some people see Scala being the natural successor to Java, indeed some of our developers have spent a little bit of time having a look at the language and the main web framework, <a href="http://liftweb.net/">Lift</a>. <a href="http://seventhings.liftweb.net/">This sells lift pretty well</a>.</p>

<p>So, why post about it - well, as well as Scala being something we should be looking at, I spotted a <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/guardian_scala">great blog post</a> talking about how the Guardian newspaper have started using Scala. Once they started, they couldn&#8217;t stop! I like this bit:</p>

<p>&#8220;After about four weeks of writing just the tests in Scala, we got fed up of having to write the main code in Java, and decided to convert the whole lot to Scala.&#8221;</p>

<p>and this bit was a real eye opener:</p>

<p>&#8220;The core Java platform that delivers <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk">www.guardian.co.uk</a> has a full release every two weeks. Compared with many enterprise Java applications, this is excellent. Compared with other websites, it&#8217;s very poor.&#8221;</p>

<p>Food for thought people, food for thought&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Whilst doing some re-work on a loan calculator, I wanted to move the configuration of the various loan rates in to the spring XML configuration. Setting up the various loan rates for the amount borrowed is relatively straightforward, but I wanted to use constants (defined only once in the app) in the map rather than straight strings. Easy you may say.. and indeed, it is if you use the &#8216;util&#8217; schema.</p>

<p>Add the util schema to your bean configuration xml</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'>    <span class="nt">&lt;beans</span> <span class="na">xmlns=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">xmlns:xsi=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">xmlns:util=</span><span class="s">&quot;http://www.springframework.org/schema/util&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="na">xsi:schemaLocation=</span><span class="s">&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">    http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.0.xsd</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">    http://www.springframework.org/schema/util</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s">    http://www.springframework.org/schema/util/spring-util-3.0.xsd&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p></p>

<p>and then you can just reference your constants as follows:&#8220;</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;util:constant</span> <span class="na">static-field=</span><span class="s">&quot;com.foo.bar.RATE_2000_2950&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
