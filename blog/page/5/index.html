  <div class="entry-content"><p>So we had a baby (planned)! At home (planned)! And there was no major damage to the house.. apart from fusing all the lights (unplanned), but you can&#8217;t win them all.</p>

<p>Her name is Iris, she was 6lbs 6oz and is a real cutie.</p>

<p>On Feb 3rd at around 5am, Clare woke up thinking contractions might have been starting. When I woke up an hour later, it hit me that maybe today was it, the beginning of the labour. In the back of my mind I was thinking that we might have a good 48 hours before our baby arrived so I didn&#8217;t need to get too worried, but I&#8217;d best phone work and stay at home to help Clare out. We were actually due 4 days later and often first babies are late, so we didn&#8217;t think we&#8217;d be in a rush.</p>

<p>At around 10am we phoned the community midwife to ask her to come around. She arrived at 2pm and said that we had deffo started, but that it all could fizzle out or continue in to the next day. After she&#8217;d gone though, we were both relieved that things were ok (blood pressure and all that) so Clare went for a bath. It was around about now that things moved up a gear &amp; it started snowing.. a lot.</p>

<p>I go the birthing pool ready and ran around the house trying to prepare everything and then at 5pm we phoned triage to ask for another midwife to come out as we were having three contractions in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>The poor midwife had just managed to get home in the snow before turning around and coming to our house. She told us that if she couldn&#8217;t make it, she&#8217;d send an ambulance and we&#8217;d have to go in to hospital.. we really didn&#8217;t want that to happen..</p>

<p>At around 6:30pm Clare&#8217;s waters broke - which wasn&#8217;t quite what I expected, I was pretty scared actually and called triage again to make sure all was ok. Midwife finally arrived at 7:15pm and we were amazed to find that we were at the 10 cm mark and ready to go!</p>

<p>The midwife called for the second midwife ( you have two for home birth ) and for the baby resuscitation &amp; the gas &amp; air kit. Clare was just using a TENS machine for pain relief at this point as you&#8217;re not supposed to get in to the birthing pool until the midwife arrives, especially first time around. Unfortunately we were now too far gone for the pool, so we decamped to our bedroom.</p>

<p>Iris by this time was facing the correct way, in the proper position and all seemed to be going well, phew. The second midwife arrived about 8pm, but the gas&#8217;n&#8217;air and resuscitation stuff didn&#8217;t arrive until about 15 minutes before Iris did, a close call - fortunately we didn&#8217;t need to use the resus equipment.</p>

<p>Just after she was born, we had some kind of spillage, through the floorboards in our bedroom, in to the light rose of the sitting room which fused all the lights in the house. This wasn&#8217;t too much of a problem until we had to call out for the third midwife to do some repairs to Clare. These repairs were done using standard, anglepoise &amp; bedside lamps - coupled with a few candles for good measure! Very dramatic!</p>

<p>Everyone left about 2:30am to leave the three of us, shattered, but happy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have in my hand a piece of paper, well, actually it is an htc hero android phone, but let&#8217;s not let that get in the way of an opening sentence..</p>

<p>Karmic Koala, Ubuntu 9.10 doesn&#8217;t take kindly when you ask it to pick up an htc hero via USB. The android developers guide gives you hints for Hardy ubuntu, but nothing more recent. Assuming you&#8217;ve followed all the other steps outlined in the <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/device.html">guide</a>, you get stuck with this output when you run</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>adb devices
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>output is:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>List of devices attached
</span><span class='line'>????????????    no permissions
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Fortunately, <a href="http://truthseekernz.blogspot.com/2009/11/ubuntu-910-and-adt-094-tangle.html">someone else</a> has done the hard work sorting out the authentication. This is what you need to do:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;&lt;span</span> <span class="na">style=</span><span class="s">&quot;font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;&quot;</span> <span class="na">class=</span><span class="s">&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;</span><span class="nt">&gt;</span>sudo vi /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules <span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>and add the following (for an HTC phone - the code changes for other devices)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'><span class="nv">SUBSYSTEMS</span><span class="o">==</span><span class="s2">&quot;usb&quot;</span>, ATTRS<span class="o">{</span>idVendor<span class="o">}==</span><span class="s2">&quot;0bb4&quot;</span>, ATTRS<span class="o">{</span>idProduct<span class="o">}==</span><span class="s2">&quot;0c01&quot;</span>, <span class="nv">MODE</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;0666&quot;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Sort out permissions for that file</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>sudo chmod a+r /etc/udev/rules.d/51-android.rules
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Then restarted the android debugging thingy (adb should be on the path after installing the Android SDK)</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>adb <span class="nb">kill</span>-server
</span><span class='line'>sudo adb start-server
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Now when you run</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='sh'><span class='line'>adb devices
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>you should get something like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.ivarjacobson.com/">Ivar Jacobson</a> is one of the architects of Rational Unified Process (RUP) and use cases and all that stuff. He gave a keynote talk at Devoxx on the state of the software engineering profession. His opening line was &#8216;Everyone knows how to develop software, but as an industry we don&#8217;t&#8217; which is a good line to start to a conference full of developers. His set up was</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Fashions - our industry follows fashions, how often do we do a project the same way as one previously. Obviously some clients prefer to work in certain ways, but having worked on three major projects recently, they have all done things in different ways. We&#8217;ve gone from OO through components through UML through Unified Process, RUP, CIMMI, 3 years ago XP, now scrum is the flavour of the month. He gave an example of meeting someone who&#8217;s business card had Phd and Certified Scrum master on it. How can you compare a two day course without any kind of test and 3+ years of research and writing! He wasn&#8217;t knocking scrum in it self, but the way in which methodologies seem to change whenever the wind blows.</p></li>
<li><p>Industry v Academic - there is often a big difference between what happens in academia and industry. Lots of great research goes knowhere and lots of practical experience doesn&#8217;t feed back in to our researchers. Seem to be playing different games. Then when you add &#8216;methodlogists&#8217; in to the mix, it gets even more confusing.</p></li>
<li><p>Methods - there are a huge number of methods, we re-invent the wheel, every methodology is a soup of new ideas, usually including one or two new ones. If you look at scrum, it isn&#8217;t all new, but just a new way of mixing it up.</p></li>
<li><p>Learn from others mistakes - why, when we can blunder on ourselves!</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So..</p>

<ul>
<li><p>We need a theory, a foundation of software engineering. We are hampered by a multitude of immature practices. The differences between them are little understood. There is a lack of creditable experimental evaluation.</p></li>
<li><p>SEMAT - a process to &#8216;re-found&#8217; software engineering based on a solid theory, proven principles and best practices. A kernel of widely agreed elements, addressing humans and technology, supported by acadameia, researchers, users and the industry. A theory which supports extension.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>Enough processes, more practices. Practice has things to do, to produce, people with competencies, using common patterns. We don&#8217;t need branded methodologies, the kernel should be practice agnostic.</p>

<p>&#8211;</p>

<p>identify kernel and own best practices then you can pull practices from other sources. Many companies throw out the good with the bad, so they junk everything and then pick up &#8216;Scrum&#8217; as a whole. Good to adopt new practices one at a time, rather than wholesale adoption.</p>

<p>&#8216;There is nothing as practical as a good theory&#8217;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jason Van Zyl was the speaker for this session, the creator of Maven - he know works for sonatype and will shortly be moving on from Maven to other things. The points below are highlight points from his talk at devoxx.</p>

<p>It was acknowledged that many things were wrong with maven 2.0 and version 3.0 is a chance to put those things right - adding extras like support for m2eclipse and osgi.</p>

<p>Maven has moved from where it originally was set up. The main driver for changes are &#8216;desire lines&#8217; - difference between how things were intended and how people used things. Responding to invitations for improvement. How people check out whole source trees, mis use of the release plugin. Responding to under utilization of what exists.</p>

<p>Maven 3 should be backwards compatible with maven 2, so we should be good to go with maven 3 - performance benefits?</p>

<p>Pluggable modelreader for project builder (which has been refactored). mixins for poms, composition for poms. Keep hold of non-mutated model and track contributions to pom. Might have a &#8216;spring mixin&#8217; or &#8216;tomcat depoy mixin&#8217; or whatever, these can be stored in the reposoitory.</p>

<p>More extension points on maven 3, decorate the lifecycle. DSLs can do all this, in groovy, ruby, scala, python.</p>

<p>The queryable lifecycle. Can query the execution plan before it happens (which is what M2Eclipse now does). Big performance increase now in eclipse.</p>

<p>Incremental build support. in M2 loads of stuff has been delegated to eclipse.</p>

<p>Lifecycle extension points Tycho - maven plugins delegates stuff to OSGI/Eclipse stuff.</p>

<p>Aggregator problems with maven 2, in 3, the post build works properly so report aggregation should work correctly.</p>

<p>Tycho is the complete replacement for PDE headless build, buckminster and everything else that attmeptes to builf OSGI.</p>

<p>Maven 3 used in hudson, M2Eclipse and netbeans already&#8230;</p>

<p>Maven shell looks brilliant, a make-like reactor, the shell caches the poms and all sorts of stuff.</p>

<p>Better error and inntegrity reporting. Lots of problems have a link to a wiki entry in confluence. Catalog to read about it. In the shell or m2eclipse, that data can be pulled in. Don&#8217;t allow builds where versions come from profiles which have to be activated manually.</p>

<p>Plugin manager, switched over to OSGI runtime, conceierge, guice and peaberry. Creating isolated classloader and stuff, but decided to switch to OSGI instead. Hudson will be switched across to OSGI as well. Plexus going in maven 3.1, replaced by Guice.</p>

<p>Plugin extension points, will be in 3.1 - rip off of Eclipse plugin.</p>

<p>Replace HTTP stuff with jetty client. SSL, PGP SUPPORT, multiple threaded downloads and all that.</p>

<p>End of january for 3.0 release.</p>

<p>Extensible reporting. Logic is now in maven site plugin rather than contined in the core. Static maven sites will probably disappear.</p>

<p>Guice and peaberry. Plexus has been going as long as spring, was ahead, but now&#8230;. not kept up. Needed more speed and injection listening - use guice with in effect a wrapper so all the plexus stuff still works as was. Use JSR330 in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Choosing a NAS solution where you can&#8217;t mount the storage media outside of the NAS is asking for trouble. I was worried I&#8217;d made the wrong choice when I found that mounting the ReadyNAS do ext3 drives is not trivial, mainly because they use a 16kb block size with their SPARC cpus.</p>

<p>A bit of routing around found various solutions, but the one which worked for me was as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fire up ubuntu vm (running on OS X for me and in my case 9.10 Karmic)</p></li>
<li><p>install lvm2 with a apt-get install lvm2</p></li>
<li><p>Download ext2fuse 0.5 (from <a href="http://linux.softpedia.com/progDownload/ext2fuse-Download-29820.html">here</a> for example)</p></li>
<li><p>run vgscan to locate drives</p></li>
<li><p>vgchange -ay c to allow access to drive</p></li>
<li><p>mkdir /mnt/lvm</p></li>
<li><p>ext2fuse /dev/c/c /mnt/lvm (where ext2fuse will have been downloaded)</p></li>
<li><p>drive can now be accessed on /mnt/lvm</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>JPA (Java Persistence API) is the standard implementation for persistence in the Java world. Although most people would probably use Hibernate (which is JPA compliant) the JPA spec gives a standard way forward for the various persistence vendors to produce compliant platforms which they can then extend with their own bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Having used JPA a few times now, I&#8217;ve found it to be well thought out and useful. However, although JPA 2.0 is around the corner there are still some improvments which could be made. Hades is an open source library which is built on top of JPA and makes producing the Data Access (DAO) layer super easy. Using convention over configuration means that simply by writing an interface with the simple queries you require is all that is required for Hades to factory produce the actual services you will need.</p>

<p>So, for example, by declaring public User findByUsername(String username);  in your service interface, Hades will automatically generate a corresponding query returning a type safe User. This works for lists as well (which solves the pain of having generic lists returned which are not type safe)</p>

<p>It uses a genericDAO service which is the JPA entity manager on steroids.</p>

<p>Proper named queries can be added to the interface and once again, Hades will implement the query for you.</p>

<p>All in all, definitely worth a look.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a relatively experienced JSF 1.2 user I have high hopes for the next generation of the JSF framework. Consequently I gave up my afternoon to have my JSF world blown away.. or something.</p>

<p>So, here are some highlights about what&#8217;s new in JSF 2</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bye bye XML -  get rid of a lot of the silly XML configuration and replace it with annotations. JSF 1.x is weighed down with it&#8217;s verbose XML config and half-baked dependency injection, JSF 2 is much better</p></li>
<li><p>Facelets is now the default renderer - and about time, using XHTML and facelets has always fitted better with JSF than compiled JSP.</p></li>
<li><p>Composite components - the component model has been souped up to be far more useable, especially with simple ways to make composites.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard AJAX tags - seem to work great but are obtrusive :(</p></li>
<li><p>Partial State saving - no more performance issues with saving the state all the time, sensible deltas are now stored, phew!</p></li>
<li><p>PreRenderViewEvent and PostAddToViewEvent - nice extendable ways to do on page load, on validation and all that stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation short cuts - instead of going crazy with navigation xml, sensible defaults are now provided. return &#8220;catalog&#8221; would default to rendering /catalog.xhtml as you would hope</p></li>
<li><p>Conditional navigation - still xml, but much cleverer now for allowing navigation logic in config rather than in the bean.</p></li>
<li><p>JSR 299 beans - full on dependency injection including flash scope and all sorts of other goodies. This looks great but a bit different from how we&#8217;ve done it with Spring in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper bean validation - annotate the domain objects and bean validation can take place in one place on the server side, all wired up to the JSF lifecycle. Looks like a lifesaver. JSR 303 @NotNull @Email - you got to love that!</p></li>
<li><p>Validation groups - can group sets of validations.. nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Pluggable error dispatcher - holy moly, this is almost the holy grail - throw errors in a sensible way with extensibility made easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Still uses web.xml though :/</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So in summary, there is lots of good stuff included in JSF 2.0, the problem is that it hasn&#8217;t been released yet, either as MyFaces or a RI implementation in a version fit for production. I want to give JSF 2.0 a go, but by that time I may have converted to wicket, or grails, or lift or loom or anything else which does most of this stuff just as well or better..</p>

<p>oh and no mention of portlets!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I&#8217;ve had some experience of working in a scrum environment, I was keen to find about other similiar methodologies. Kanban (which literally means - visual card) is a methodology direct from manufacturing, specifically in Japan. Limits and constraints are embraced to allow the smooth flow of tasks.</p>

<p>A board is used to map flow of tasks, but generally with extra steps compared to a scrum board. Some of these steps are buffers, indicating that there may be inefficiencies or constraints which are hindering the flow, i.e. tasks which are in the &#8216;awaiting uploading&#8217; stage indicates that the uploading stage may have inefficiencies which constrain the throughput.</p>

<p>Each stage has a limit, nominally set to twice the number of people working on the stage minus 1. The limits can be amended , but care must be taken that flow is increased rather than decreased. Work is managed on a pull basis. No one pushes work from left to right, people pull the work from the previous stage. This changes the stress that people encounter, they can only work at the limit which is set, they are not allowed to take on work which would take them above the limit. They can only take things on when they have spare capacity.</p>

<p>I love how it works when there is spare capacity. If there is no task to pick up from the previous stage and say there are too many tasks in the test stage, then rather than jumping in to help someone else or do some testing, use the time to improve the efficiency of the process. Write a tool to make deployment faster etc. It&#8217;s in an inbuilt part of the processes that inefficiencies (when people are idle) work as a positive feedback loop in to the process to then speed things up, self healing!</p>

<p>It was felt that kanban worked particularly well with</p>

<ul>
<li>dedicated teams - keeps variance low</li>
<li>tasks of a similar size - again variance</li>
<li>better on maintenance than big build projects, although it can work with both.</li>
</ul>


<p>Trust underpins it all, building trust for teams and for the client/customer. When we estimate we always add security, then others add further security and on and on we go until the actual estimates are wildly different from how long it takes to do the piece of work!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re blocked you can&#8217;t take on extra work over your limit. Forces concentration on blockers! Each worker has a magnet for the board, they have two magnets which are attached to whatever they are working on, they cannot work on anything else. Forces completion of tasks, and if there is idle time, work on the process.</p>

<p>No planning or estimating in proper kanban process, the devs do the dev, testers test. Someone still has to break the tasks down, but there is an element of ensuring the spec&#8217;d bits are the right size too.</p>

<p>The board uses different coloured postits and blockers are stuck on tasks which are stuck. Each day which a task remains in a stage, annotate it with a dot, so you can see how fast it is going.</p>

<p>A few side notes: as a knowledge worker it&#8217;s important to remember that knowledge is perishable, if we accumulate it but don&#8217;t use it then it will decay&#8230;.</p>

<p>if you are sawing down a tree, is it worth stopping to sharpen your saw on a regular basis? Why yes!</p>

<p>For my workplace, I think we still have a lot to learn from scrum - have we ensured that we&#8217;re following scrum properly and learning the lessons from that before we&#8217;d think about taking a new process on. However, there are some principles which are always worth thinking about, especially when it comes to trust within organisations. If however, we had a maintenance team, with analysts, devs, testers - across projects, then I think kanban could prove really useful</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;m really pleased to be at Devoxx this year which is the biggest Java conference in Europe. Today around 3000 people turned up for day 1 of the university sessions. I ended up going to the following sessions</p>

<ol>
<li>Kanban methodology in the morning</li>
<li>New features of JSF2 in the afternoon</li>
<li>Half hour session on hades and JPA</li>
<li>Half hour session on Spock, the testing framework.</li>
</ol>
