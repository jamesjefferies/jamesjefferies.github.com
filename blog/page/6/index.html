  <div class="entry-content"><p>Jason Van Zyl was the speaker for this session, the creator of Maven - he know works for sonatype and will shortly be moving on from Maven to other things. The points below are highlight points from his talk at devoxx.</p>

<p>It was acknowledged that many things were wrong with maven 2.0 and version 3.0 is a chance to put those things right - adding extras like support for m2eclipse and osgi.</p>

<p>Maven has moved from where it originally was set up. The main driver for changes are &#8216;desire lines&#8217; - difference between how things were intended and how people used things. Responding to invitations for improvement. How people check out whole source trees, mis use of the release plugin. Responding to under utilization of what exists.</p>

<p>Maven 3 should be backwards compatible with maven 2, so we should be good to go with maven 3 - performance benefits?</p>

<p>Pluggable modelreader for project builder (which has been refactored). mixins for poms, composition for poms. Keep hold of non-mutated model and track contributions to pom. Might have a &#8216;spring mixin&#8217; or &#8216;tomcat depoy mixin&#8217; or whatever, these can be stored in the reposoitory.</p>

<p>More extension points on maven 3, decorate the lifecycle. DSLs can do all this, in groovy, ruby, scala, python.</p>

<p>The queryable lifecycle. Can query the execution plan before it happens (which is what M2Eclipse now does). Big performance increase now in eclipse.</p>

<p>Incremental build support. in M2 loads of stuff has been delegated to eclipse.</p>

<p>Lifecycle extension points Tycho - maven plugins delegates stuff to OSGI/Eclipse stuff.</p>

<p>Aggregator problems with maven 2, in 3, the post build works properly so report aggregation should work correctly.</p>

<p>Tycho is the complete replacement for PDE headless build, buckminster and everything else that attmeptes to builf OSGI.</p>

<p>Maven 3 used in hudson, M2Eclipse and netbeans already&#8230;</p>

<p>Maven shell looks brilliant, a make-like reactor, the shell caches the poms and all sorts of stuff.</p>

<p>Better error and inntegrity reporting. Lots of problems have a link to a wiki entry in confluence. Catalog to read about it. In the shell or m2eclipse, that data can be pulled in. Don&#8217;t allow builds where versions come from profiles which have to be activated manually.</p>

<p>Plugin manager, switched over to OSGI runtime, conceierge, guice and peaberry. Creating isolated classloader and stuff, but decided to switch to OSGI instead. Hudson will be switched across to OSGI as well. Plexus going in maven 3.1, replaced by Guice.</p>

<p>Plugin extension points, will be in 3.1 - rip off of Eclipse plugin.</p>

<p>Replace HTTP stuff with jetty client. SSL, PGP SUPPORT, multiple threaded downloads and all that.</p>

<p>End of january for 3.0 release.</p>

<p>Extensible reporting. Logic is now in maven site plugin rather than contined in the core. Static maven sites will probably disappear.</p>

<p>Guice and peaberry. Plexus has been going as long as spring, was ahead, but now&#8230;. not kept up. Needed more speed and injection listening - use guice with in effect a wrapper so all the plexus stuff still works as was. Use JSR330 in the future.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Choosing a NAS solution where you can&#8217;t mount the storage media outside of the NAS is asking for trouble. I was worried I&#8217;d made the wrong choice when I found that mounting the ReadyNAS do ext3 drives is not trivial, mainly because they use a 16kb block size with their SPARC cpus.</p>

<p>A bit of routing around found various solutions, but the one which worked for me was as follows.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Fire up ubuntu vm (running on OS X for me and in my case 9.10 Karmic)</p></li>
<li><p>install lvm2 with a apt-get install lvm2</p></li>
<li><p>Download ext2fuse 0.5 (from <a href="http://linux.softpedia.com/progDownload/ext2fuse-Download-29820.html">here</a> for example)</p></li>
<li><p>run vgscan to locate drives</p></li>
<li><p>vgchange -ay c to allow access to drive</p></li>
<li><p>mkdir /mnt/lvm</p></li>
<li><p>ext2fuse /dev/c/c /mnt/lvm (where ext2fuse will have been downloaded)</p></li>
<li><p>drive can now be accessed on /mnt/lvm</p></li>
</ol>


<p>Hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>JPA (Java Persistence API) is the standard implementation for persistence in the Java world. Although most people would probably use Hibernate (which is JPA compliant) the JPA spec gives a standard way forward for the various persistence vendors to produce compliant platforms which they can then extend with their own bells and whistles.</p>

<p>Having used JPA a few times now, I&#8217;ve found it to be well thought out and useful. However, although JPA 2.0 is around the corner there are still some improvments which could be made. Hades is an open source library which is built on top of JPA and makes producing the Data Access (DAO) layer super easy. Using convention over configuration means that simply by writing an interface with the simple queries you require is all that is required for Hades to factory produce the actual services you will need.</p>

<p>So, for example, by declaring public User findByUsername(String username);  in your service interface, Hades will automatically generate a corresponding query returning a type safe User. This works for lists as well (which solves the pain of having generic lists returned which are not type safe)</p>

<p>It uses a genericDAO service which is the JPA entity manager on steroids.</p>

<p>Proper named queries can be added to the interface and once again, Hades will implement the query for you.</p>

<p>All in all, definitely worth a look.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a relatively experienced JSF 1.2 user I have high hopes for the next generation of the JSF framework. Consequently I gave up my afternoon to have my JSF world blown away.. or something.</p>

<p>So, here are some highlights about what&#8217;s new in JSF 2</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bye bye XML -  get rid of a lot of the silly XML configuration and replace it with annotations. JSF 1.x is weighed down with it&#8217;s verbose XML config and half-baked dependency injection, JSF 2 is much better</p></li>
<li><p>Facelets is now the default renderer - and about time, using XHTML and facelets has always fitted better with JSF than compiled JSP.</p></li>
<li><p>Composite components - the component model has been souped up to be far more useable, especially with simple ways to make composites.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard AJAX tags - seem to work great but are obtrusive :(</p></li>
<li><p>Partial State saving - no more performance issues with saving the state all the time, sensible deltas are now stored, phew!</p></li>
<li><p>PreRenderViewEvent and PostAddToViewEvent - nice extendable ways to do on page load, on validation and all that stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation short cuts - instead of going crazy with navigation xml, sensible defaults are now provided. return &#8220;catalog&#8221; would default to rendering /catalog.xhtml as you would hope</p></li>
<li><p>Conditional navigation - still xml, but much cleverer now for allowing navigation logic in config rather than in the bean.</p></li>
<li><p>JSR 299 beans - full on dependency injection including flash scope and all sorts of other goodies. This looks great but a bit different from how we&#8217;ve done it with Spring in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper bean validation - annotate the domain objects and bean validation can take place in one place on the server side, all wired up to the JSF lifecycle. Looks like a lifesaver. JSR 303 @NotNull @Email - you got to love that!</p></li>
<li><p>Validation groups - can group sets of validations.. nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Pluggable error dispatcher - holy moly, this is almost the holy grail - throw errors in a sensible way with extensibility made easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Still uses web.xml though :/</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So in summary, there is lots of good stuff included in JSF 2.0, the problem is that it hasn&#8217;t been released yet, either as MyFaces or a RI implementation in a version fit for production. I want to give JSF 2.0 a go, but by that time I may have converted to wicket, or grails, or lift or loom or anything else which does most of this stuff just as well or better..</p>

<p>oh and no mention of portlets!</p>

      <p class="meta">
        








  


<time datetime="2009-11-16T19:27:38+00:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Nov 16<span>th</span>, 2009</time>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I&#8217;ve had some experience of working in a scrum environment, I was keen to find about other similiar methodologies. Kanban (which literally means - visual card) is a methodology direct from manufacturing, specifically in Japan. Limits and constraints are embraced to allow the smooth flow of tasks.</p>

<p>A board is used to map flow of tasks, but generally with extra steps compared to a scrum board. Some of these steps are buffers, indicating that there may be inefficiencies or constraints which are hindering the flow, i.e. tasks which are in the &#8216;awaiting uploading&#8217; stage indicates that the uploading stage may have inefficiencies which constrain the throughput.</p>

<p>Each stage has a limit, nominally set to twice the number of people working on the stage minus 1. The limits can be amended , but care must be taken that flow is increased rather than decreased. Work is managed on a pull basis. No one pushes work from left to right, people pull the work from the previous stage. This changes the stress that people encounter, they can only work at the limit which is set, they are not allowed to take on work which would take them above the limit. They can only take things on when they have spare capacity.</p>

<p>I love how it works when there is spare capacity. If there is no task to pick up from the previous stage and say there are too many tasks in the test stage, then rather than jumping in to help someone else or do some testing, use the time to improve the efficiency of the process. Write a tool to make deployment faster etc. It&#8217;s in an inbuilt part of the processes that inefficiencies (when people are idle) work as a positive feedback loop in to the process to then speed things up, self healing!</p>

<p>It was felt that kanban worked particularly well with</p>

<ul>
<li>dedicated teams - keeps variance low</li>
<li>tasks of a similar size - again variance</li>
<li>better on maintenance than big build projects, although it can work with both.</li>
</ul>


<p>Trust underpins it all, building trust for teams and for the client/customer. When we estimate we always add security, then others add further security and on and on we go until the actual estimates are wildly different from how long it takes to do the piece of work!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re blocked you can&#8217;t take on extra work over your limit. Forces concentration on blockers! Each worker has a magnet for the board, they have two magnets which are attached to whatever they are working on, they cannot work on anything else. Forces completion of tasks, and if there is idle time, work on the process.</p>

<p>No planning or estimating in proper kanban process, the devs do the dev, testers test. Someone still has to break the tasks down, but there is an element of ensuring the spec&#8217;d bits are the right size too.</p>

<p>The board uses different coloured postits and blockers are stuck on tasks which are stuck. Each day which a task remains in a stage, annotate it with a dot, so you can see how fast it is going.</p>

<p>A few side notes: as a knowledge worker it&#8217;s important to remember that knowledge is perishable, if we accumulate it but don&#8217;t use it then it will decay&#8230;.</p>

<p>if you are sawing down a tree, is it worth stopping to sharpen your saw on a regular basis? Why yes!</p>

<p>For my workplace, I think we still have a lot to learn from scrum - have we ensured that we&#8217;re following scrum properly and learning the lessons from that before we&#8217;d think about taking a new process on. However, there are some principles which are always worth thinking about, especially when it comes to trust within organisations. If however, we had a maintenance team, with analysts, devs, testers - across projects, then I think kanban could prove really useful</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>try saying &#8220;Spring configuration namespace resolution&#8221; with a mouthful of tea.</p>

<p>Anyway, from Spring 2.5, one can use the new namespace resolution functionality in your spring configuration. We&#8217;ve used this for example (by the way, http bits have lost a slash - stops them getting wordpress&#8217;d), here:</p>

<p>Which allows you to use the namespace amq in your spring configuration, i.e.</p>

<p>spring knows that amq maps to the active mq schema, and as we provide a url in the location section, it knows where it can get it from.</p>

<p>The only downside to this is when apache.org goes down, as it did last week. Spring tries to look up the schema, can&#8217;t and consequently fails to start. This is catastrophic.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find out how to work around this, ideally I&#8217;d like Spring to get the xsd from the classpath (where I&#8217;ve put it) rather than trying to download it from the internet. Just in case apache.org disappears up it&#8217;s own firewall.. again.</p>

<p>The change is simple, if you know how. Chuck the .xsd schema file in src/main/resources and update the config as follows, change in red - hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a little gnome applet running which tells me how fast my CPUs are running. Annoyingly, they seem to be lazing about at 2.0Ghz, saving energy and all that, speeding up (allegedly) when required.</p>

<p>This seemed like a bit of cop out to me, I want them running at 2.3Ghz, their max speed, when I&#8217;m compiling and running apps! I&#8217;m all for saving energy, but I want the control.</p>

<p>Well, now I have it thanks to a bit of reconfiguring..</p>

<p>Running this allows the CPU speed applet to change the settings (with root permission). So, I have changed it from On Demand to Performance. Hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With maven, running web apps with embedded tomcat &amp; jetty is brill&#8230; as long as you have a straightforward configuration, not requiring lots of extra dependencies. The maven jetty plugin is super configurable though and can be tweaked as required.</p>

<p>org.mortbay.jetty</p>
