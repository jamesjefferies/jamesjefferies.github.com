  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a relatively experienced JSF 1.2 user I have high hopes for the next generation of the JSF framework. Consequently I gave up my afternoon to have my JSF world blown away.. or something.</p>

<p>So, here are some highlights about what&#8217;s new in JSF 2</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Bye bye XML -  get rid of a lot of the silly XML configuration and replace it with annotations. JSF 1.x is weighed down with it&#8217;s verbose XML config and half-baked dependency injection, JSF 2 is much better</p></li>
<li><p>Facelets is now the default renderer - and about time, using XHTML and facelets has always fitted better with JSF than compiled JSP.</p></li>
<li><p>Composite components - the component model has been souped up to be far more useable, especially with simple ways to make composites.</p></li>
<li><p>Standard AJAX tags - seem to work great but are obtrusive :(</p></li>
<li><p>Partial State saving - no more performance issues with saving the state all the time, sensible deltas are now stored, phew!</p></li>
<li><p>PreRenderViewEvent and PostAddToViewEvent - nice extendable ways to do on page load, on validation and all that stuff.</p></li>
<li><p>Navigation short cuts - instead of going crazy with navigation xml, sensible defaults are now provided. return &#8220;catalog&#8221; would default to rendering /catalog.xhtml as you would hope</p></li>
<li><p>Conditional navigation - still xml, but much cleverer now for allowing navigation logic in config rather than in the bean.</p></li>
<li><p>JSR 299 beans - full on dependency injection including flash scope and all sorts of other goodies. This looks great but a bit different from how we&#8217;ve done it with Spring in the past.</p></li>
<li><p>Proper bean validation - annotate the domain objects and bean validation can take place in one place on the server side, all wired up to the JSF lifecycle. Looks like a lifesaver. JSR 303 @NotNull @Email - you got to love that!</p></li>
<li><p>Validation groups - can group sets of validations.. nice.</p></li>
<li><p>Pluggable error dispatcher - holy moly, this is almost the holy grail - throw errors in a sensible way with extensibility made easy.</p></li>
<li><p>Still uses web.xml though :/</p></li>
</ul>


<p>So in summary, there is lots of good stuff included in JSF 2.0, the problem is that it hasn&#8217;t been released yet, either as MyFaces or a RI implementation in a version fit for production. I want to give JSF 2.0 a go, but by that time I may have converted to wicket, or grails, or lift or loom or anything else which does most of this stuff just as well or better..</p>

<p>oh and no mention of portlets!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Now I&#8217;ve had some experience of working in a scrum environment, I was keen to find about other similiar methodologies. Kanban (which literally means - visual card) is a methodology direct from manufacturing, specifically in Japan. Limits and constraints are embraced to allow the smooth flow of tasks.</p>

<p>A board is used to map flow of tasks, but generally with extra steps compared to a scrum board. Some of these steps are buffers, indicating that there may be inefficiencies or constraints which are hindering the flow, i.e. tasks which are in the &#8216;awaiting uploading&#8217; stage indicates that the uploading stage may have inefficiencies which constrain the throughput.</p>

<p>Each stage has a limit, nominally set to twice the number of people working on the stage minus 1. The limits can be amended , but care must be taken that flow is increased rather than decreased. Work is managed on a pull basis. No one pushes work from left to right, people pull the work from the previous stage. This changes the stress that people encounter, they can only work at the limit which is set, they are not allowed to take on work which would take them above the limit. They can only take things on when they have spare capacity.</p>

<p>I love how it works when there is spare capacity. If there is no task to pick up from the previous stage and say there are too many tasks in the test stage, then rather than jumping in to help someone else or do some testing, use the time to improve the efficiency of the process. Write a tool to make deployment faster etc. It&#8217;s in an inbuilt part of the processes that inefficiencies (when people are idle) work as a positive feedback loop in to the process to then speed things up, self healing!</p>

<p>It was felt that kanban worked particularly well with</p>

<ul>
<li>dedicated teams - keeps variance low</li>
<li>tasks of a similar size - again variance</li>
<li>better on maintenance than big build projects, although it can work with both.</li>
</ul>


<p>Trust underpins it all, building trust for teams and for the client/customer. When we estimate we always add security, then others add further security and on and on we go until the actual estimates are wildly different from how long it takes to do the piece of work!</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re blocked you can&#8217;t take on extra work over your limit. Forces concentration on blockers! Each worker has a magnet for the board, they have two magnets which are attached to whatever they are working on, they cannot work on anything else. Forces completion of tasks, and if there is idle time, work on the process.</p>

<p>No planning or estimating in proper kanban process, the devs do the dev, testers test. Someone still has to break the tasks down, but there is an element of ensuring the spec&#8217;d bits are the right size too.</p>

<p>The board uses different coloured postits and blockers are stuck on tasks which are stuck. Each day which a task remains in a stage, annotate it with a dot, so you can see how fast it is going.</p>

<p>A few side notes: as a knowledge worker it&#8217;s important to remember that knowledge is perishable, if we accumulate it but don&#8217;t use it then it will decay&#8230;.</p>

<p>if you are sawing down a tree, is it worth stopping to sharpen your saw on a regular basis? Why yes!</p>

<p>For my workplace, I think we still have a lot to learn from scrum - have we ensured that we&#8217;re following scrum properly and learning the lessons from that before we&#8217;d think about taking a new process on. However, there are some principles which are always worth thinking about, especially when it comes to trust within organisations. If however, we had a maintenance team, with analysts, devs, testers - across projects, then I think kanban could prove really useful</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>try saying &#8220;Spring configuration namespace resolution&#8221; with a mouthful of tea.</p>

<p>Anyway, from Spring 2.5, one can use the new namespace resolution functionality in your spring configuration. We&#8217;ve used this for example (by the way, http bits have lost a slash - stops them getting wordpress&#8217;d), here:</p>

<p>Which allows you to use the namespace amq in your spring configuration, i.e.</p>

<p>spring knows that amq maps to the active mq schema, and as we provide a url in the location section, it knows where it can get it from.</p>

<p>The only downside to this is when apache.org goes down, as it did last week. Spring tries to look up the schema, can&#8217;t and consequently fails to start. This is catastrophic.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to find out how to work around this, ideally I&#8217;d like Spring to get the xsd from the classpath (where I&#8217;ve put it) rather than trying to download it from the internet. Just in case apache.org disappears up it&#8217;s own firewall.. again.</p>

<p>The change is simple, if you know how. Chuck the .xsd schema file in src/main/resources and update the config as follows, change in red - hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have a little gnome applet running which tells me how fast my CPUs are running. Annoyingly, they seem to be lazing about at 2.0Ghz, saving energy and all that, speeding up (allegedly) when required.</p>

<p>This seemed like a bit of cop out to me, I want them running at 2.3Ghz, their max speed, when I&#8217;m compiling and running apps! I&#8217;m all for saving energy, but I want the control.</p>

<p>Well, now I have it thanks to a bit of reconfiguring..</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>Running this allows the CPU speed applet to change the settings (with root permission). So, I have changed it from On Demand to Performance. Hurrah!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With maven, running web apps with embedded tomcat &amp; jetty is brill&#8230; as long as you have a straightforward configuration, not requiring lots of extra dependencies. The maven jetty plugin is super configurable though and can be tweaked as required.</p>

<p>To get the jetty plugin working though, you need to add the following to your settings.xml</p>

<p>org.mortbay.jetty</p>

<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that, it should pick up fine with mvn jetty:run for jetty or mvn tomcat:run for tomcat</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When using <a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/tomahawk-project/tomahawk12/tagdoc/t_inputFileUpload.html">Tomahawk&#8217;s file upload component</a> it isn&#8217;t obvious how to catch what happens when you blow the file size limit. The file limit is set in the web.xml configuration for Tomahawk, i.e.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;filter-class&gt;</span>org.apache.myfaces.webapp.filter.ExtensionsFilter<span class="nt">&lt;/filter-class&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;init-param&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;description&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  Set the size limit for uploaded files. Format: 10 - 10
</span><span class='line'>  bytes 10k - 10 KB 10m - 10 MB 1g - 1 GB
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/description&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;param-name&gt;</span>uploadMaxFileSize<span class="nt">&lt;/param-name&gt;</span>

</span><span class='line'>    .....
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/filter&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here you can see the limit is set to 10 meg.</p>

<p>So by default, if you blow the limit, the component fails silently.. or does it?</p>

<p>Well, the component actually adds a couple of attributes to the request when refreshing the page (following the click of the upload button). The attributes are:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='xml'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;span&gt;</span>org.apache.myfaces.custom.fileupload.exception<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>org.apache.myfaces.custom.fileupload.maxSize<span class="nt">&lt;/span&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>by checking the request (during the page render) you can grab these attributes, if set, and display something meaningful to the user. You could have a little render tag at the top of the page to ensure the attributes are checked. Whilst this is a bit cronky, it is one of the jsf workarounds which does work.. in a fashion.</p>

<p>If they are present and you want to display the max size to the user, then apache commons FileUtils comes along to save the day</p>

<p><a href="http://commons.apache.org/io/api-release/org/apache/commons/io/FileUtils.html#byteCountToDisplaySize">org.apache.commons.io.FileUtils.byteCountToDisplaySize</a>;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Standard practice with tomcat is that the application is deployed under a directory which is derived from the name of the war file archive which is deployed.</p>

<p>i.e. foo.war will be deployed to the foo directory and will be accessed with the URL http://application-server-url/foo</p>

<p>All well and good, but what if you want to access it as http://app-server-url/   ?</p>

<p>a number of approaches were tried, none of which worked 100%, they part worked or ended up with the application being deployed twice. Pain, pain, pain.</p>

<p>Trying to use docbase in the server.xml, i.e.</p>

<p><code>&lt;Context path="" docBase="foo" debug="1"/&gt;</code></p>

<p>will result in the application being deployed to / and /foo - not good, we only want it deployed once.</p>

<p>So, take a step back. Only one application can be deployed under / and for tomcat, this defaults to one called ROOT.war, so rather than creating and deploying foo.war, call it ROOT.war and it will deploy to /, once and everyone is happy.</p>
