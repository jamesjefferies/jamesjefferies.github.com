    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The other day I went to the first event for the new <a href="http://dotforgeaccelerator.com">Dotforge Accelerator</a> program in Sheffield.</p>

<p>Having been following the progress of a couple of Sheffield companies, <a href="http://www.orderharmony.com/">OrderHarmony</a> and <a href="http://matchchat.co.uk/">Matchchat</a> during the <a href="http://ignite100.com/">Ignite100</a> accelerator program in Newcastle Upon Tyne, I was interested to find out what is planned for Sheffield.</p>

<p>This is my write up.</p>

<h2>What is it?</h2>

<p>Dotforge is going to follow the same kind of pattern as Ignite100 and other programs. A 13 week intense program consisting of a number of cycles, pitches, mentoring, training, building, creating, destroying, tweaking and learning.</p>

<p>By the end of the program, teams will be able to pitch to investors in Sheffield &amp; in London, to hopefully provide funding for their startup business to make the next big steps.</p>

<p>It is being run by <a href="http://twitter.com/jagusti">Jag Goraya</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/germinates">Emma Cheshire</a>.</p>

<h2>Focus</h2>

<p>The investor's main focus is on products which</p>

<ul>
<li>Take advantage of the 'Cloud'</li>
<li>Work as Business to Business (B2B) products</li>
<li>use Big Data or Social data</li>
<li>have the capability for high growth</li>
<li>have global ambition</li>
<li>web technologies</li>
<li>consider Sheffield strengths, for example

<ul>
<li>e-learning</li>
<li>e-health</li>
<li>advanced manufacturing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Teams</h2>

<p>Applications are encourgaged from teams of 3 to 4 people. Preferably from people who already know each other or have worked together, but there are no real hard and fast rules.</p>

<p>A lone founder could apply and get on the program, but usually people find that they are so busy during the 13 weeks, that the load needs to be shared out amongst other team members, you can't be in two places at the same time.</p>

<p>A good mix of skills is required, having development skills as well as ideas is recommended.</p>

<h2>The beans</h2>

<h3>Initial money</h3>

<p>Each company on the program gets Â£5k investment, per person (up to three team members) for a 6% stake in the company. The 6% is made up of the various investors who are funding the program.</p>

<p>Around half of all companies on these programs end up getting decent investment offers at the end, i.e. hundreds of thousands of pounds.</p>

<h3>Location</h3>

<p>There will be an office in Sheffield city centre, where the teams will be located for the 13 weeks. The focus for the teams will be on the program, trying to juggle other interests at the same time will always be possible, but you get out of the program what you put in.</p>

<h3>Perks</h3>

<p>There are often benefits associated with being on an accelerator program, credit for Amazon web services or Rackspace for example. This would enable growth without having to worry quite as much about infrastructure costs.</p>

<h2>When?</h2>

<p>Applications will be open shortly, the program will commence after Easter 2013. The application platform is hosted by <a href="http://www.f6s.com/dotforge-2013-spring">f6s</a> and will be their standard process.</p>

<h2>Process</h2>

<p>Teams will go through various application stages, including telephone interviews and face to face interviews</p>

<h2>Well?</h2>

<p>I'm certainly going to consider this very carefully to see whether I can form or join a team for this accelerator and whether it is the right time for me.</p>

<p>If you're working on a startup, or have a cracking idea, then you really should have a look and consider applying!</p>
