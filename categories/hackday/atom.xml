<p>Thanks to the <a href="/2012/10/16/railway-hackday-off-the-rails/">Off The Rails</a> hackday, I was able to team up with some fellow software engineers to build something in a day. Our team consisted of <a href="http://twitter.com/frankieroberto">Frankie Roberto</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jnicho02">Jez Nicholson</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/joooe">Joe Hughes</a>. Frankie had had the idea for building an application which would show sights of interest visible from the train route, indicating rough placements and which side of the train to look on. I knew Frankie from Sheffield, Frankie had worked with Jez before on a previous hackday and Joe was interested in what we were doing, our team was formed!</p>

<p>Interestingly, during the 'speed dating' section at the beginning of the day, when we chatted to other people about their ideas and what they were thinking of building, one chap, whose name I think was Phil, was thinking about Railway iSpy, which sounds pretty similar to what we actually built (without Big Chief i-Spy though!). Our application also bears an uncanny similiarity to the Peppa Pig episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htl6NYcBE-k">The Train Ride!</a></p>

<p>After some discussion on ideas, scope, implementation and the <a href="http://www.railperf.org.uk/">Railway Performance Society</a> we started building a Rails web application and an iOS app. Although I know a lot about railways, I'm still in the early days of learning Rails and iOS, so the patience of Jez and Frankie whilst building <a href="http://www.scenicrailways.org.uk">Scenic Railways</a> was much appreciated. So whilst the three of us built the web application, Joe got cracking with building an iOS application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scenic-railways-on-iphone.png" alt="ios-1" /></p>

<p>We got an initial version built in the time we had (from about 11am until 7pm) before the presentations were due to start. I worked on a bit of map integration using <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">leaflet.js</a> whilst Jez and Frankie implemented the main structure.</p>

<p>Although the version we finished was relatively basic, there are some nice features, the best one being that the sides to look out of the window on, reverse depending on direction of travel!  It could easily be extended in the future to add extra routes and extra points of interest (POIs). Joe had some ideas on making the iOS app competitive, by providing incentives for people to take photos of the points from the train!</p>

<p>So, feel free to have a look at the site <a href="http://www.scenicrailways.org.uk">Scenic Railways</a> and you can even checkout the code from <a href="https://github.com/frankieroberto/scenic-railways">github</a> and laugh at my Rails code (or lack of it!).</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/off_the_rails_sponsors1.png" title="Off The Rails" alt="off the rails image" /></p>

<p>After being Technologist in Residence at <a href="http://sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> earlier in the year, as part of the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project</a> I started to think of some ideas I wanted to follow for later in 2012.</p>

<h2>Hackday</h2>

<p>One of those ideas was to run a <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hack-days">Hackday</a>, but not any old Hackday, one centred around Railways. Network Rail had just opened up their realtime <a href="http://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk">Datafeeds</a> and as far as I knew, no one else had ever run one. Sure, there had been Transport Hackdays, but not Railway specific ones.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>So I got to work, I went to experience a 24 hour hackday for myself, where I discovered that sometimes technical issues with the building can really slow people's progress and that working overnight doesn't really suit me anymore!</p>

<h2>Clickerty Hack</h2>

<p>I also bought a domain and registered a Twitter account. The hackday would be called Clickerty Hack. Then, having a good read of <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hackday Manifesto</a> made me realise that a lot of work was required to get a decent Hackday up and running.</p>

<h2>Loco 2 and Off The Rails</h2>

<p>It was then that I found out about somebody else's plans for a Railway Hackday, <a href="http://loco2.com">loco2</a> was a company I was already watching with interest. A startup based around European Train travel, ticketing and guides.</p>

<p>Their hackday, Off the Rails, was in a more advanced state than Clickerty Hack, so putting it on hold, I volunteered to help.</p>

<h2>ShedCode Sponsorship</h2>

<p>It was a real privilege to be able to help with a small part of the organising and for my company <a href="http://shedcode.co.uk">ShedCode</a> to be one of the sponsors, providing some of the food for the masses!</p>

<h2>Meeting the experts</h2>

<p>During 2012, I'd found a number of people who had built some incredible pieces of software using Railway data, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/poggs">Peter Hicks</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/swlines">Tom Cairns</a> who built, amongst other things <a href="http://www.opentraintimes.com/">Open Train Times</a> and <a href="http://traintimes.im">Train Times</a> respectively. So it was brilliant to meet them in person at Off The Rails. There were also many other people knowledgeable about Railways, Open Data and Mapping - I could have spent all day just talking to people!</p>

<h2>The teams</h2>

<p>During the day, the teams built some inspiring things, including an application which builds spotify playlists to match the length of your train journey and many others. Most of them will hopefully be available at some point on github for perusal.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>All in all, a fantastic day, thanks to <a href="http://loco2.com">Loco2</a> and <a href="http://bethnalgreenventures.com">Bethnal Green Ventures</a> and here's to the next Railway Hackday, whether it's Off The Rails 2, or Clickerty Hack! With cake too of course ;)</p>
