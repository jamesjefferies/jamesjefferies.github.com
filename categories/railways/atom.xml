    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been a fair bit of discussion in the press about where Sheffield's High Speed station is to be situated for HS2. The leaks indicate that Meadowhall is the likely location. Most recently in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/9783576/HS2-route-Manchester-and-Liverpool-win-while-Sheffield-loses-out.html">Daily Telegraph</a></p>

<p>My local MP, Paul Blomfield also <a href="http://www.paulblomfield.co.uk/news/news-story/article/the-rail-minister-is-getting-it-badly-wrong-by-proposing-that-sheffields-hs2-station-should-be-at-m.html">supports a city centre station for HS2</a> instead of Meadowhall.</p>

<p>I'd like to make a few points about why Meadowhall makes some sense for a new station, Tinsley Yard makes even more sense and then I'll  provide some other examples of getting the station in to the city centre instead.</p>

<h2>High Speed 2 (HS2)</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hs2.org.uk/">HS2</a> is a new High Speed line planned to be built over the next 30 odd years from London Euston, initially to Birmingham, before splitting in to two arms, one to Manchester, the other to Leeds (via the East Midlands and South Yorkshire). Speed is projected to be up to 225mph with an estimated journey time from the South Yorkshire station of 1 hour 10 minutes.</p>

<h2>Current and near future plans for Sheffield</h2>

<p>The fastest trains at the moment take 2 hours and 7 minutes to travel from Sheffield Midland station to London St. Pancras via Chesterfield, Derby and Leicester.</p>

<p>Following electrification of the Midland Mainline, projected times to London would be 1 hour 45 minutes within the next 5 years.</p>

<h2>Common Design Patterns for High Speed stations</h2>

<p>Although currently the UK has very few High Speed stations (St. Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet, Ashford), Europe, especially France has a lot more experience of building and siting them. The common design patterns which are generally used are:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Intermediate stations are on passing loops, allowing non-stop trains to pass straight through at maximum speed - like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MMNlsatk18">this</a>. This means the station is generally long and straight, requiring enough room for the loops too. Platforms for HS2 are planned to be about 415m.</p></li>
<li><p>Stations are often out of town to allow easy access for a wide variety of people, including huge car parks for drivers. The equivalent for the UK at the moment is the 'Parkway' station, like at East Midlands.</p></li>
<li><p>Speed is rarely compromised, and when it is, it is usually because of important cross-connections and infrastructure, i.e. Lille Europe, where a massive new station was built with major disruption. So you rarely get through stations built on bends or in city centres!</p></li>
<li><p>A new UK example will be the station provided outside Birmingham, the plans are available for <a href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-maps-20120110/hs2arp00drrw05303issue2.pdf">download</a></p></li>
<li><p>HS2 stations are going to be designed for speedy embarkation, the trains are nearly half a kilometre long, so passengers will be directed to the right carriage <em>before</em> the train arrives. There will be no last minute jumping on with these trains.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Why Meadowhall/Tinsley Yard makes sense</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Space - there is far more brownfield space around Meadowhall for building new infrastructure. There is also room to move businesses around if required.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing infrastructure - the station would be on the tram network, serving Sheffield and by then Rotheram too. The M1 travels right by on the Tinsley Viaduct</p></li>
<li><p>It meets the common design patterns outlined above.</p></li>
<li><p>Area - it would serve South Yorkshire, not just Sheffield City Centre.</p></li>
<li><p>If built in the old Tinsley Yard, there is a lots of good space for it to go. Access could be provided at either end.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Why it doesn't make sense</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Meadowhall is already busy as a transport hub, especially the M1</p></li>
<li><p>It will add a good 15-20 minutes on to the journey time from the City Centre, giving a similar time to the new 'classic' electrified service  anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>City Centre businesses need a city centre station for growth (so they say).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Route considerations</h2>

<p>At the time of writing we do not know which route HS2 is set to take through South Yorkshire.</p>

<p>HS routes though, again, have common design patterns</p>

<ul>
<li>no sharp curves which would reduce speed unless absolutely necessary. These trains are not built to tilt.</li>
<li>gradients aren't usually too much of a problem.</li>
<li>High density population areas to be avoided otherwise extensive soundproofing is required.</li>
</ul>


<p>Consequently, I'd be surprised if HS2 was to be routed parallel to the existing mainline route via Dore and the Sheaf valley. You probably could squeeze the infrastrure in and you might have an ideal alignment for the existing Midland station.</p>

<p>However, what is more likely would be a route around the 'old route' where Sheffield's trains from the South originally came from. This is the route you might have experienced when engineering works force a diversion. You leave Sheffield to the North, turn right through Darnall, Woodhouse, before bearing South back round to Chesterfield.</p>

<p>So, I could see a route which heads round the East of Sheffield, avoiding the centre completely, before heading North to Meadowhall to a South Yorkshire Parkway station.</p>

<h2>City Centre station (Midland)</h2>

<p>Let's assume that the route <em>can</em> be built along the Sheaf valley, parallel to the existing mainline. What do you do when you get to Sheffield Midland station?</p>

<p>You can't build underneath it, because that is where the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richboxfrenzy/sets/72157631911926282/">Megatron</a> is. Midland station is built on top of the river.</p>

<p>You could build on top of it but building a bigger station on top of a smaller station would make a bit of a mess.</p>

<p>You could completely knock down Midland station and rebuild it.</p>

<p>You could incorporate it in to the existing station, but some platforms would require demolishing and there would be extreme capacity issues for existing services.</p>

<p>It would end up taking about <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=203170883012533158238.0004d2c9c0c74fc9d440f">this much</a> space.</p>

<h2>City Centre station (Victoria)</h2>

<p>If the route of HS2 heads around the East of Sheffield, then why not use the old Victoria station? The alignment is correct for incoming trains and you could have a dedicated station there with, say a tramlink to Midland?</p>

<p>Well, I think the problem there is that trains heading for Leeds would then end up pointing towards Hillsborough, Oughtibridge and Stocksbridge. You would need some serious infrastructure (big tunnel) to get the route back to a more Northerly direction to continue the journey to Leeds. Not impossible, but adds a lot of cost.</p>

<h2>Hybrid using Victora &amp; Midland Stations</h2>

<p>One off the wall idea, might be to re-open Victoria as a mainline station, re-open the line to Penistone, then divert some of the trains currently using Midland to a new Victoria Station.</p>

<p>Services to Lincoln, Leeds (Northern), Barnsley, Huddersfield could all use Victoria with Cross Country and East Midlands then using a reduced size Midland, creating extra space to build High Speed platforms there.</p>

<h2>Tinsley Yard</h2>

<p>This seems to be the best location for alignment and existing space. The long lost Marshalling Yard is in a great location for the Motorway, not that far from Meadowhall and would probably be good for noise and local housing. I think there is a good chance that it will be used as the final location.</p>

<p>Someone has done a great route example <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210155476846284269415.0004a7028d801cf5385bd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=53.401243,-1.384234&amp;spn=0.013868,0.027423">here</a> - looks very plausible to me.</p>

<h2>Meadowhall itself</h2>

<p>The more I look at maps and consider routes, the more I think that a route passing across the valley parallel to the M1 is likely, rather than one parallel to the current mainline at Meadowhall. So, imagine a station under the Tinsley Viaduct, at 90 degree angles to the existing main line. Probably then, with tunnels either side.</p>

<h2>My vote</h2>

<p>Goes to Tinsley Yard. If you want to get quickly to London in 2032 from Sheffield City Centre. Take the Electrified Midland Mainline to St. Pancras in 1 hour 45 minutes. It'll probably be cheaper than HS2, be more scenic and will not take much longer.</p>

<p>If you don't live in the City Centre and you drive, park up at the HS2 station next to the M1, get there early and whizz down HS2 to Euston in 1 hour 10-15 minutes. Either way will get you in to the centre of London fairly sharpish. Win win!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Amazon Pickup Lockers</h2>

<p>This year, Amazon launched it's Pick up lockers and Collection locations. A great idea for a mail order company, providing delivery alternatives for customers so they don't have to put up with the, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/24/amazon-complaints-yodel-delivery-service">generally awful</a>, parcel delivery services. Having had parcels left outside houses and in rubbish bins, it's good to know you can collect, at your convenience from a location you have chosen.</p>

<h2>The Oxford - Cambridge Railway</h2>

<p>Then, the other weekend, I was on a railway line I'd never been on before, the Bletchley to Bedford line, which joins the West Coast Main Line, to the Midland Main Line, serving lots of small stations on route. A lot of work has been done on the infrastructure recently, as <a href="http://www.railfuture.org.uk/ox-cam/">services get extended</a> from Bletchley towards Oxford, and hopefully one day, back towards Cambridge. The line will also be electrified as part of the <a href="http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/07/16/the-electrified-spine-and-the-rest-of-the-news/">'electric spine'</a>.</p>

<h2>How about...</h2>

<p>About half way along this route, is a massive Amazon warehouse. Although it is next to the railway line, it isn't rail served, there are no sidings set up for transferring goods. It got me thinking though, if local and major railway stations had Amazon pick up lockers, then they could be rail served in a really efficient way. Of course there would be infrastructure costs, getting Amazon warehouses linked up, but once that was done, a really efficient way of delivering goods.</p>

    <updated>2012-10-16T16:22:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/10/16/scenic-railways-our-railway-hack</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/scenic-railways.png" alt="screen shot of application" /></p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="/2012/10/16/railway-hackday-off-the-rails/">Off The Rails</a> hackday, I was able to team up with some fellow software engineers to build something in a day. Our team consisted of <a href="http://twitter.com/frankieroberto">Frankie Roberto</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jnicho02">Jez Nicholson</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/joooe">Joe Hughes</a>. Frankie had had the idea for building an application which would show sights of interest visible from the train route, indicating rough placements and which side of the train to look on. I knew Frankie from Sheffield, Frankie had worked with Jez before on a previous hackday and Joe was interested in what we were doing, our team was formed!</p>

<p>Interestingly, during the 'speed dating' section at the beginning of the day, when we chatted to other people about their ideas and what they were thinking of building, one chap, whose name I think was Phil, was thinking about Railway iSpy, which sounds pretty similar to what we actually built (without Big Chief i-Spy though!). Our application also bears an uncanny similiarity to the Peppa Pig episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htl6NYcBE-k">The Train Ride!</a></p>

<p>After some discussion on ideas, scope, implementation and the <a href="http://www.railperf.org.uk/">Railway Performance Society</a> we started building a Rails web application and an iOS app. Although I know a lot about railways, I'm still in the early days of learning Rails and iOS, so the patience of Jez and Frankie whilst building <a href="http://www.scenicrailways.org.uk">Scenic Railways</a> was much appreciated. So whilst the three of us built the web application, Joe got cracking with building an iOS application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scenic-railways-on-iphone.png" alt="ios-1" /></p>

<p>We got an initial version built in the time we had (from about 11am until 7pm) before the presentations were due to start. I worked on a bit of map integration using <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">leaflet.js</a> whilst Jez and Frankie implemented the main structure.</p>

<p>Although the version we finished was relatively basic, there are some nice features, the best one being that the sides to look out of the window on, reverse depending on direction of travel!  It could easily be extended in the future to add extra routes and extra points of interest (POIs). Joe had some ideas on making the iOS app competitive, by providing incentives for people to take photos of the points from the train!</p>

<p><img src="/images/scenic-railways-1.png" alt="screen shot of application" /></p>

<p>So, feel free to have a look at the site <a href="http://www.scenicrailways.org.uk">Scenic Railways</a> and you can even checkout the code from <a href="https://github.com/frankieroberto/scenic-railways">github</a> and laugh at my Rails code (or lack of it!).</p>

    <link href="http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/10/16/railway-hackday-off-the-rails/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-16T15:12:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/10/16/railway-hackday-off-the-rails</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img src="/images/off_the_rails_sponsors1.png" title="Off The Rails" alt="off the rails image" /></p>

<p>After being Technologist in Residence at <a href="http://sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> earlier in the year, as part of the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project</a> I started to think of some ideas I wanted to follow for later in 2012.</p>

<h2>Hackday</h2>

<p>One of those ideas was to run a <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hack-days">Hackday</a>, but not any old Hackday, one centred around Railways. Network Rail had just opened up their realtime <a href="http://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk">Datafeeds</a> and as far as I knew, no one else had ever run one. Sure, there had been Transport Hackdays, but not Railway specific ones.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>So I got to work, I went to experience a 24 hour hackday for myself, where I discovered that sometimes technical issues with the building can really slow people's progress and that working overnight doesn't really suit me anymore!</p>

<h2>Clickerty Hack</h2>

<p>I also bought a domain and registered a Twitter account. The hackday would be called Clickerty Hack. Then, having a good read of <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hackday Manifesto</a> made me realise that a lot of work was required to get a decent Hackday up and running.</p>

<h2>Loco 2 and Off The Rails</h2>

<p>It was then that I found out about somebody else's plans for a Railway Hackday, <a href="http://loco2.com">loco2</a> was a company I was already watching with interest. A startup based around European Train travel, ticketing and guides.</p>

<p>Their hackday, Off the Rails, was in a more advanced state than Clickerty Hack, so putting it on hold, I volunteered to help.</p>

<h2>ShedCode Sponsorship</h2>

<p>It was a real privilege to be able to help with a small part of the organising and for my company <a href="http://shedcode.co.uk">ShedCode</a> to be one of the sponsors, providing some of the food for the masses!</p>

<h2>Meeting the experts</h2>

<p>During 2012, I'd found a number of people who had built some incredible pieces of software using Railway data, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/poggs">Peter Hicks</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/swlines">Tom Cairns</a> who built, amongst other things <a href="http://www.opentraintimes.com/">Open Train Times</a> and <a href="http://traintimes.im">Train Times</a> respectively. So it was brilliant to meet them in person at Off The Rails. There were also many other people knowledgeable about Railways, Open Data and Mapping - I could have spent all day just talking to people!</p>

<h2>The teams</h2>

<p>During the day, the teams built some inspiring things, including an application which builds spotify playlists to match the length of your train journey and many others. Most of them will hopefully be available at some point on github for perusal.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>All in all, a fantastic day, thanks to <a href="http://loco2.com">Loco2</a> and <a href="http://bethnalgreenventures.com">Bethnal Green Ventures</a> and here's to the next Railway Hackday, whether it's Off The Rails 2, or Clickerty Hack! With cake too of course ;)</p>
