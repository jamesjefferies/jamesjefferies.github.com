    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There has been a fair bit of discussion in the press about where Sheffield's High Speed station is to be situated for HS2. The leaks indicate that Meadowhall is the likely location. Most recently in the <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/road-and-rail-transport/9783576/HS2-route-Manchester-and-Liverpool-win-while-Sheffield-loses-out.html">Daily Telegraph</a></p>

<p>My local MP, Paul Blomfield also <a href="http://www.paulblomfield.co.uk/news/news-story/article/the-rail-minister-is-getting-it-badly-wrong-by-proposing-that-sheffields-hs2-station-should-be-at-m.html">supports a city centre station for HS2</a> instead of Meadowhall.</p>

<p>I'd like to make a few points about why Meadowhall makes some sense for a new station, Tinsley Yard makes even more sense and then I'll  provide some other examples of getting the station in to the city centre instead.</p>

<h2>High Speed 2 (HS2)</h2>

<p><a href="http://www.hs2.org.uk/">HS2</a> is a new High Speed line planned to be built over the next 20 odd years from London Euston, initially to Birmingham, before splitting in to two arms, one to Manchester, the other to Leeds (via the East Midlands and South Yorkshire). Speed is projected to be up to 225mph with an estimated journey time from the South Yorkshire station of 1 hour 10 minutes. The route to Leeds &amp; South Yorkshire is due to be open by <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/britain-to-have-new-national-high-speed-rail-network">2033</a></p>

<h2>Current and near future plans for Sheffield</h2>

<p>The fastest trains at the moment take 2 hours and 7 minutes to travel from Sheffield Midland station to London St. Pancras via Chesterfield, Derby and Leicester.</p>

<p>Following electrification of the Midland Mainline, projected times to London would be 1 hour 45 minutes within the next 5 years.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong> - actually, electrification from Derby to Sheffield will take place by December 2021 in <a href="http://www.networkrail.co.uk/browse%20documents/strategicbusinessplan/cp5/supporting%20documents/our%20activity%20and%20expenditure%20plans/route%20plans/east%20midlands%20route%20plan.pdf">Control Period 6</a></p>

<h2>Common Design Patterns for High Speed stations</h2>

<p>Although currently the UK has very few High Speed stations (St. Pancras, Stratford, Ebbsfleet, Ashford), Europe, especially France has a lot more experience of building and siting them. The common design patterns which are generally used are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Intermediate stations are on passing loops, allowing non-stop trains to pass straight through at maximum speed. This means the station is generally long and straight, requiring enough room for the loops too. Platforms for HS2 are planned to be about 415m.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is a train passing at high speed!</p>

<iframe class="youtube-player" type="text/html" width="640" height="385" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/9MMNlsatk18" frameborder="0">
</iframe>


<ul>
<li><p>Stations are often out of town to allow easy access for a wide variety of people, including huge car parks for drivers. The equivalent for the UK at the moment is the 'Parkway' station, like at East Midlands.</p></li>
<li><p>Speed is rarely compromised, and when it is, it is usually because of important cross-connections and infrastructure, i.e. Lille Europe, where a massive new station was built with major disruption. So you rarely get through stations built on bends or in city centres!</p></li>
<li><p>A new UK example will be the station provided outside Birmingham, the plans are available for <a href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/hs2-maps-20120110/hs2arp00drrw05303issue2.pdf">download</a></p></li>
<li><p>HS2 stations are going to be designed for speedy embarkation, the trains are nearly half a kilometre long, so passengers will be directed to the right carriage <em>before</em> the train arrives. There will be no last minute jumping on with these trains.</p></li>
<li><p>Stations shouldn't be too close together. A purist route would have a terminus at Leeds, a station outside Birmingham and a terminus at London Euston, that would be the most efficent and that's your lot!</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Why Meadowhall/Tinsley Yard makes sense</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Space - there is far more brownfield space around Meadowhall for building new infrastructure. There is also room to move businesses around if required.</p></li>
<li><p>Existing infrastructure - the station would be on the tram network, serving Sheffield and by then Rotheram too. The M1 travels right by on the Tinsley Viaduct.</p></li>
<li><p>It meets the common design patterns outlined above.</p></li>
<li><p>Area - it would serve South Yorkshire, not just Sheffield City Centre. Most of the official documentation I have seen references South Yorkshire, not <em>Sheffield</em></p></li>
<li><p>If built in the old Tinsley Yard, there is a lots of good space for it to go. Access could be provided at either end.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Why it doesn't make sense</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Meadowhall is already busy as a transport hub, especially the M1.</p></li>
<li><p>It will add a good 15-20 minutes on to the journey time from the City Centre, giving a similar time to the new 'classic' electrified service  anyway.</p></li>
<li><p>City Centre businesses need a city centre station for growth (so they say, I've not read up on any research in to this).</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Route considerations</h2>

<p>At the time of writing we do not know which route HS2 is set to take through South Yorkshire. Consultation is due in 2014.</p>

<p>High Speed routes though, again, have common design patterns</p>

<ul>
<li><p>no sharp curves which would reduce speed unless absolutely necessary. These trains are not built to tilt.</p></li>
<li><p>gradients aren't usually too much of a problem, compared to normal trains and routes. High Speed lines often have 'motorway' style gradients.</p></li>
<li><p>High density population areas to be avoided otherwise extensive soundproofing &amp; demolishment is required.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Consequently, I'd be surprised if HS2 was to be routed parallel to the existing mainline route via Dore and the Sheaf valley. You probably could squeeze the infrastructure in and you might have an ideal alignment for the existing Midland station.</p>

<p>However, what is more likely would be a route around the East Side of Sheffield where the trains from the South originally came from, before the route along the Sheaf valley was built towards Dore. This is the route you might have experienced when engineering works force a diversion. You leave Sheffield to the North, turn right through Darnall, Woodhouse, before bearing South back round to Chesterfield past Staveley and Barrow Hill.</p>

<p>So, I could see a route which heads round the East of Sheffield, avoiding the centre completely, before heading North to Meadowhall to a South Yorkshire Parkway station.</p>

<h2>City Centre station (Midland)</h2>

<p>Let's assume that the route <em>can</em> be built along the Sheaf valley, parallel to the existing mainline. What do you do when you get to Sheffield Midland station?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>You can't build underneath it, because that is where the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/richboxfrenzy/sets/72157631911926282/">Megatron</a> is. Midland station is built on top of the river.</p></li>
<li><p>You could build on top of it but building a bigger station on top of a smaller station would make a bit of a mess.</p></li>
<li><p>You could completely knock down Midland station and rebuild it.</p></li>
<li><p>You could incorporate it in to the existing station, but some platforms would require demolishing and there would be extreme capacity issues for existing services.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>It would end up taking about <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=203170883012533158238.0004d2c9c0c74fc9d440f">this much</a> space.</p>

<h2>City Centre station (Victoria)</h2>

<p>If the route of HS2 heads around the East of Sheffield, then why not use the old Victoria station? The alignment is correct for incoming trains and you could have a dedicated station there with, say a tramlink to Midland?</p>

<p>Well, I think the problem there is that trains heading for Leeds would then end up pointing towards Hillsborough, Oughtibridge and Stocksbridge. You would need some serious infrastructure (i.e. a big tunnel) to get the route back to a more Northerly direction to continue the journey to Leeds. Not impossible, but adds a lot of extra cost.</p>

<h2>Hybrid using Victora &amp; Midland Stations</h2>

<p>One off the wall idea, might be to re-open Victoria as a mainline station, re-open the line to Penistone, then divert some of the trains currently using Midland to a new Victoria Station.</p>

<p>Services to Lincoln, Leeds (Northern), Barnsley, Huddersfield could all use Victoria with Cross Country and East Midlands then using a reduced size Midland, creating extra space to build High Speed platforms there.</p>

<p>Of course, re-opening Woodhead would be the icing on the cake!</p>

<h2>Tinsley Yard</h2>

<p>This seems to be the best location for alignment and existing space. The long lost Marshalling Yard is in a great location for the Motorway, not that far from Meadowhall and would probably be good for noise and local housing. I think there is a good chance that it will be used as the final location.</p>

<p>Someone has done a great route example <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps/ms?msid=210155476846284269415.0004a7028d801cf5385bd&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=53.401243,-1.384234&amp;spn=0.013868,0.027423">here</a> - looks very plausible to me.</p>

<p>NB. I found that route on a Sheffield Forum <a href="http://www.sheffieldforum.co.uk/showpost.php?p=7828103&amp;postcount=72">post</a></p>

<h2>Meadowhall itself</h2>

<p>The more I look at maps and consider routes, the more I think that a route passing across the valley parallel to the M1 is likely, rather than one parallel to the current mainline at Meadowhall. So, imagine a station under the Tinsley Viaduct, at 90 degree angles to the existing main line. Probably then, with tunnels either side.</p>

<h2>My vote</h2>

<p>If we end up with a station in South Yorkshire, then my vote goes to Tinsley Yard. If you want to get quickly to London in 2032 from Sheffield City Centre. Take the Electrified Midland Mainline to St. Pancras in 1 hour 45 minutes. It'll probably be cheaper than HS2, be more scenic and will not take much longer.</p>

<p>If you don't live in the City Centre and you drive, park up at the HS2 station next to the M1, get there early and whizz down HS2 to Euston in 1 hour 10-15 minutes. Either way will get you in to the centre of London fairly sharpish. Win win!</p>

    <updated>2012-09-25T22:15:00+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/09/25/the-creativity-tap</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>The Creativity Tap</h2>

<p>Creativity is just like a tap right? You need to do some thing a bit woo and a bit wah, so you switch on the creativity tap and all these incredible ideas just pour out of your brain. There are two dangers though if you use the creativity tap.</p>

<p>One is that if you leave that tap switched off for a while, then all the creativity gets stored up in your brain, without an outlet until... Pop! One day it’s gone, those ideas had to go somewhere, so they leaked out, usually somewhere behind your ear, hopefully picked up by someone else. You have writers block, coders deadlock, songwriters... err, song block. Oh dear</p>

<p>The other danger is that you leave that tap switched on all the time until your brain empties. This too is a bad idea, sure, you’ve made some room in your noddle for new things, but you need a few left in there, to keep the ideas factory ticking over. Oh double dear...</p>

<h2>Writing Songs</h2>

<p>Knowing people who are songwriters, I get the privilege of seeing songs appear, until they end up being recorded and performed, or they mutate into a different song, or they end up on the shelf, maybe for another day. I’m sure not every songwriter works like this, but those I know have to <em>work</em> at honing a song. They rarely appear fully formed but they often appear when there is space in their lives to switch on the creativity tap for a bit to see what happens.</p>

<p>If they don’t have the chance to get the songs <em>out</em>, into the open, then you can see how those song ideas start to play merry hell. The frustration builds, no time for the songs, too busy having to do other stuff. It’s almost a physical pain, the song <em>has</em> to be brought to life. There is a creative imperative which must be fulfilled.</p>

<h2>Writing Code</h2>

<p>Fortunately, for us software engineers, coders, developers, tapping at our keyboards day by day, telling the computer what to do and when to do it, we don’t need the creativity tap. We get stuck? We ask a search engine. We need to do something from scratch? Well, <em>someone</em> will have done something like it, we just need to find it and copy them. We need another pair of eyes? Well, ask a colleague. It’s all there for us, if we use a clever framework or development environment, it’ll probably autocomplete what we’re thinking too. We are coding machines..</p>

<p>Or are we? Having spent many years writing code, I started to realise that when I was mechanistic in what I was doing, I became frustrated that I wasn’t able to come up with new ideas or ways of doing things. I was constrained by getting this piece of work finished in as short a period of time that was possible. No time to switch on the creativity tap, just <em>get it done</em>.</p>

<p>The big problem is when you work for someone else, you can find yourself under a lot of pressure to crank the sausage machine handle rather than think things through. I worked with an engineer once, who would deliberately stop what he was doing and just <em>think</em>. Rather than thrashing through a jungle of code... stop first and think. It worked too, giving a bit of time to turn on the creativity tap to see what happened.</p>

<p>I struggled in my day to day job, so I tried to make time in the evenings and the weekends. But you’re so tired then that switching on the creativity tap just floods you with ideas which you don’t have the energy to either make note of or do anything with. Like the frustrated songwriter I would feel the pain of not learning new skills, not playing with languages and technology. Not actually chuffing making anything which made you say, even if it is just to yourself “I made that and I’m pleased with what I’ve done”.</p>

<p>So, what can be done?</p>

<p>Well one answer, in the workplace, where people have a pressurised, day to day job and a boss, is for the bosses to give people time when they have the headspace to play. With their work, with something new, with wooden blocks, with a great idea they’ve had. Not only do they get chance to switch on the creativity tap, but usually it knocks on in to their ‘day to day’ work too. Wins all around.</p>

<p>If you are your own boss, then plan in time where you put down the work you’re doing for clients or your startup and have a play. You never know what amazing ideas might come to life!</p>

<p>Disclaimer - the creativity tap premise is a load of nonsense, if only it was a tap we could switch on and off!</p>

    <link href="http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/07/16/the-electrified-spine-and-the-rest-of-the-news/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-16T15:39:04+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/07/16/the-electrified-spine-and-the-rest-of-the-news</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today the government has announced a further set of infrastructure investment for the railways. This has to be good news, especially where electrification is concerned. Electric trains are more efficient, cleaner and perform better than their diesel (and steam I suppose!) counterparts. I appreciate that the electricity still has to come from somewhere, but in the main it is the right thing to do.</p>

<h2>Already Announced</h2>

<p>We know that plans to electrify the Great Western Mainline (Paddington to Cardiff, Bristol, Oxford &amp; Newbury), plus the Trans-Pennine route between Manchester &amp; York, Blackpool and Manchester to Liverpool are already underway. These are all good things, but there were some unsatisfactory omissions. The new announcement helps with some of the missing links, but not all of them.</p>

<p>There is a helpful <a href="http://assets.dft.gov.uk/publications/hlos-2012/map-hlos-electrification.pdf">map</a> which shows these routes in glorious technicolour</p>

<h2>New Plans - Midland Mainline</h2>

<p>Hooray, the Midland Mainline, which has been electrified to Bedford for many years is to be electrified to Nottingham and Sheffield (via Derby). For those of us who regularly travel to London from Sheffield we should experience a faster service. Not necessarily more trains though, no extra track is to be laid and unless signalling is replaced, you can't fit that many more trains on the track.</p>

<p>As far as I'm aware, there has been no announcement about rolling stock either, the simple solution for East Midlands Trains (assuming they're still running the franchise) will be to get the existing Meridian trains upgraded with an extra coach containing all of the required electrical equipment, plus pantograph for current collection etc. Easier said than done, but a lot cheaper than brand new trains. So it is likely you'll still be sitting on the same seat.</p>

<h2>Missed Opportunities - Midland Mainline</h2>

<h3>Erewash Valley</h3>

<p>Why or why isn't the Erewash valley route included as part of the plans? This is the line which goes straight on at the junction for Derby and Nottingham, joining up with the Sheffield line between Clay Cross and Chesterfield - it's the most direct route to Sheffield and is useful when engineering works close the route via Derby. Very few London bound trains use this route, most are routed via Derby from Sheffield, but electrifying it would be useful for diversions and could give the opportunity for Sheffield, Leicester, London services which don't call at Derby, potentially shaving more time off the journey.</p>

<h3>Sheffield to Leeds</h3>

<p>Groan, everybody wants a better service between Leeds and Sheffield, the best being the 45 minute Cross Country packed like a sardine train which goes via Wakefield. Why not electrify that route too so that more London trains can be extended easily to Leeds? Plus get some more electrified suburban stoppers on that route. Derby to Leeds semi-fast?</p>

<h3>Sheffield to Doncaster</h3>

<p>Whilst we're at it, how about the link to Doncaster too, providing more opportunities for diversions and commuter services?</p>

<h2>New Plans - Oxford to Corby &amp; Nuneaton</h2>

<p>This wasn't on my radar at all, but makes a lot of sense for new cross country routes as well as faster Birmingham to London trains via Oxford. Incorporating the start of the Oxford to Cambridge route (as far as Bedford) makes sense with that re-opening. The potential for new routes, well re-establishing old routes should give that part of the country a much better service.</p>

<h2>New Plans - Reading to Southampton</h2>

<p>Cross country trains mainly use this route at the moment and it is partially already electrified using the Southern standard 3rd Rail system. Over the next... err.. 50 years (?) the 3rd rail system will be phased out and replaced with the standard 25kv AC overhead system. This is the beginning of that process and also good preparation for Cross Country. Birmingham to Southampton trains will be electric all the way, as might, say Sheffield to Southampton trains, routed via Oxford.</p>

<h2>The Spine</h2>

<p>According to the plan, the Electrified Spine is to be the Southampton to Coventry and Sheffield routes and is a piece of spin. If I had a spine looking like that I'd be worried! The only new route, as far as I can see is the already announced re-opening of the Oxford to Bedford route, everywhere else is straightforward electrification.</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I'm very happy to see these extra plans announced, but would like to understand more about why some very obvious links and connections have been omitted. What to others think?</p>

    <id>http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/05/31/whatever-next</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3>Then</h3>

<p>This time last year I was in despair, I wasn’t enjoying my job and it was getting me down. Up to that point I’d spent 6 years writing software for Barclays, 5 years writing software for npower/Yorkshire Electricity, 3 years writing software for the digital agency Technophobia. I could feel myself getting stale and much as I enjoyed working with a lot of my colleagues, it felt to me like I needed a bit of a change.</p>

<p>During August 2011, I left <a href="http://www.technophobia.com">Technophobia</a> and set up my own limited company ShedCode without much of an idea what to do next! Fortunately I was able to get off with a cracking start; I was able to share an office above the <a href="http://www.sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> in Sheffield City Centre with 3 good friends and then I was able to do some standard contracting work, 4 days a week to get some funds in the coffers.</p>

<p>Having an office was key to me going freelance, I didn’t really want to work from home, too many distractions, but sharing a small office with people I like and can trust was ideal. Being at tenant at Site also meant that I started to meet people in the building, both staff &amp; other tenants. It’s a great place to work &amp; it’s also where I first heard about the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project.</a> In a nutshell, the project is a 10 week residency for technologists in Arts Organisations of which Site was to be one of them.</p>

<h2>Happenstance</h2>

<p>After umming and ahhing a bit about applying, I decided to go for it, the weekend before the deadline. The actual application process was really useful for me, helping me to work out some ideas about what I wanted to do next, with my career and ShedCode. To cut a long story short, I managed to get a place as one of the residents and at the point of writing this, we’re 7 weeks into the 10 weeks.</p>

<p>Time really flies when you’re having fun and learning new things and so far that sums the residency up nicely. We’ve built thermal printing sentient characters from Wuthering Heights which are mobile, tweet and respond to SMS text messages. An incredible polargraph drawing machine as well as fixing lots of technical things for the Site organisation itself. You can read more about what we’ve been up to on the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com/blog">happenstance project blog</a> and our <a href="http://happenstancesheffield.tumblr.com/">tumblr </a>site.</p>

<p>I’ve hankered after Research &amp; Development time for years and getting the odd day here or there hasn’t been enough. This residency though has been a mixture of R&amp;D and practical help for the organisation and it has seriously got me thinking. It’s one thing to have an idea, it’s something else though to have the time to actually try and get it to work. There have been nights after working on happenstance when I have not been able to sleep as my brain has been working overtime trying to solve problems... I feel a bit more alive!</p>

<p>The question now though for me, is</p>

<h2>Whatever next?</h2>

<p>I’m pretty good, if I can blow my own trumpet for a minute, at technical problem solving. From laser printers, to wireless networks, to security, to domains, even WordPress. As a problem solver and nosy chuffer, you don’t spend 17 years working without picking up some knowledge of what your colleagues do!</p>

<p>I’ve spent most of my time though writing and designing software. I’m not the best software engineer in the world, in fact there’s a lot of my code out there which other people now have to support for which I apologise most sincerely, but I’m not a bad all rounder.</p>

<p>Once Happenstance finishes, at the end of June, I’d like to take some time to work on some of my own projects. I’ve got two railway related products I’d like to build, plus a project for school kids and then at least one other one which is coming together.</p>

<p>Since being a Technologist in Residence though, it’s given me the hunger to get involved in other things too. It’s been a real privilege working with my fellow resident <a href="http://finalbullet.com">Leila Johnston</a>, she is a great writer, inventor and organiser of exciting events and has an incredible network of interesting people who do really interesting things.</p>

<p>And as I wrote that sentence above, it’s when I thought, hang on, that’s what I’m after. I think I WANT TO BE AN INTERESTING PERSON! So that people can say, "Hey, you know who you should get in to do such and such, you could do a lot worse than hire that friendly freelancer James Jefferies!"</p>

    <id>http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/05/04/week-3-cathy-heathcliffs-amazing-adventures</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week has given us a real opportunity to do something interesting with Cathy &amp; Heathcliff, we spent two of our three days out of the Site office to get our heads down.</p>

<p>The first challenge was to allow 6th Formers to send messages to Cathy &amp; Heathcliff. At first we thought of hooking them up directly to twitter accounts, but as Leila had a <a href="http://twilio.com">Twilio</a> account, it meant that we could do something clever with SMS Text messages. With a bit of PHP magic on an intermediary server (timescales demanded a quick turnaround!) we managed to get the SMS messages sent to the two printers. Hooray!</p>

<p>The next step was to bypass the button on the Arduino device which you had to push each time a message arrived. We edited the C code and uploaded the new code to the devices so that instead of waiting for the button to be pushed, the green light flashed and it printed without intervention. Hooray x 2!</p>

<p>Finally, we wanted to get the messages sent to Cathy and Heathcliff's twitter accounts - @CathyPrinter @HeathcliffPrinter - initially we looked a using the PHP OAuth libraries to authenticate and send the message to twitter, but as neither of us are particularly adept at PHP, we decided on a different solution. Using <a href="http://ifttt.com">If This Then That</a> and some server side magic, we send an email from the server, via their gmail accounts to If This Then That, which then passes them on to their twitter accounts.. Hooray x 3!</p>

<p>You can see us setting them up on our <a href="http://happenstancesheffield.tumblr.com">tumblr site</a>.</p>
