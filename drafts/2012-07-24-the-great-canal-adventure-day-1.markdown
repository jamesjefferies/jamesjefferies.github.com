Our plan for our first proper canal holiday was to take a boat from Middlewich, in Cheshire, up to Llangollen, over the border in Wales. Picking the boat up from the Boat Yard at Saturday lunchtime, meant that we were going to have to get a wiggle on if we wanted to get all the way to Llangollen. Especially as the boat had to be back by 9am the following Saturday!

We decided that we'd aim for Trevor, after the two spectacular aqueducts and nearly all the way to Llangollen. The final bit is narrow, busy and wiggly, not the easiest route on a 69 foot boat.

The canal is a narrow (for 7ft boats) canal, with a maxiumum length of 72 foot. Our boat, Stavanger Fjord, at 69 foot is almost as long as you can get. As it was, it felt a bit hairy at times in some of the locks! 

The boat, was great - two bathrooms, with showers, gas cooker, nice beds, room for the little nipper at the back, places to sit & an inverter so we could watch Liverpool FC play their European match on the Thursday night!

The main crew, was Lucy, Clare, Iris & Myself but throughout the trip we had help from my Mum, Clare's Mum & Andy Brown for the final leg.
