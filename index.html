  <div class="entry-content"><h2>More details on the Olympic servers</h2>

<p>Thanks to a lot of investigation by <a href="http://twitter.com/interpipes">@interpipes</a> we now have some more details about these servers.</p>

<p>It looks like Acer/Gateway built the servers on top of one of these SuperMicro <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/system/2U/2026/SYS-2026T-URF4_.cfm">Super Servers 2026T-URF4+</a></p>

<p>consisting of one of these <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/motherboard/qpi/5500/x8dtu_.cfm">motherboards</a></p>

<p>with one of these <a href="http://www.supermicro.com/products/chassis/2U/213/SC213A-R740W.cfm">chassis</a></p>

<h2>Where was the server used</h2>

<p>Apparently, one of the three letter codes on the server can tell you where the server was located. Mine, seems to have SDC on it, but I haven&#8217;t been able to find out if that is a location or not.</p>

<p>This <a href="http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aiCDaaSXo1oJ:www.dalkeithtransport.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Olympic-Venues-for-UP-Deliveries.xls+&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk">spreadsheet</a> is the UPS delivery cheatsheet, no SDC on there.</p>

<h2>State of servers on delivery</h2>

<p>The RAID card was loose in the server case when I unpacked mine, which I&#8217;m glad I spotted before firing up for the first time. Once re-attached, all seems fine.</p>

<p>I also thought mine was broken, but actually, it was what you might call a user error! What I hadn&#8217;t realised was that if you only plug in one of the power supplies, then the server lets you know that one of the power supplies might be broken by sounding a continous BEEEEEEEP! So don&#8217;t make that error, plug both power leads in!</p>

<p>Once again, @interpipes to the rescue! &#8220;beeping is just to tell you one of the supplies is &#8220;failed&#8221; - pull it out (an inch)/plug it in, and it&#8217;ll stop beeping.&#8221;</p>

<p>@interpipes also had some interesting configurations too on his servers
&#8220;Half of mine had bios passwords set, half didn&#8217;t, and 3 had a configuration on the BMC controllers.&#8221;</p>

<h3>Advice on getting in to the BMC via @interpipes</h3>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseboard_management_controller">BMC</a> is the Baseboard Management Controller, an extra microcontroller which servers to manage server kind of things at a lower level.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Getting back into the BMC (which among other things gives you full IP KVM access), </p><p>first, set up the network configuration for it in the BIOS as if it has been configured it&#8217;ll have a static IP set the network config is under Server Management, and then the first option in that menu - I forget what it is called - I recommend using the dedicated LAN port setting, which is the solitary lan port above the two usb sockets. </p><p>Now you can get to it over your lan (pointing a web browser at it being the easiest way) but you&#8217;ll need to use ipmitool to change the root user password back to something you know (then you can log in and reset the BMC to factory defaults). Using the BMC it&#8217;s possible to mount an ISO from a windows file share (I think you can also mount one from a local disk when connected to the remote control interface) to install the system from entirely remotely.&#8221;</p></blockquote>


<h2>Installing an OS</h2>

<p>Now that I could start mine up without it beeping the place down, I entered the RAID configuration and set up a simple 146Gb RAID1 set up, using the 2x146Gb 10k RPM 2.5&#8221; disks it came with.</p>

<p>I also used <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net">Unetbootin</a> to get a server ISO set up on my old USB memory stick. Of course, it&#8217;s up to you to choose your favourite Linux distro, Unetbootin will allow you to download a customised ISO too which it will then set up on the USB, so you are not limited to the ones it comes with by default.</p>

<p>The server quite happily booted off the USB stick, so no optical drive is required (my server didn&#8217;t have one).</p>

<h2>What&#8217;s next?</h2>

<p>Getting the OS installed and, I think Xen set up.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>For the Olympics, a whole lot of techie kit was required to do lots of clever things. As a lot of the kit wasn&#8217;t required after the games were over, they have been made available for purchase at super cheap prices! Kit was originally for Educational Establishments, but once that batch were sold, I could buy one. So I did!</p>

<h2>Server Model - Gateway GR380 F1</h2>

<p>Well, I hadn&#8217;t realised that the Gateway brand had been brought back to life, but it has by Acer! The Gateway GR380 F1 - you can have a look at the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/d2xvncz">spec</a> if you like.  It is a 2U (i.e. bigger) version of one of <a href="http://www.pcpro.co.uk/reviews/servers/359875/gateway-gr360-f1">these</a> coming with 2x146Gb drives, lots of memory and a big cardboard box.</p>

<p><img src="/images/big-server.jpeg" alt="bigserver" /></p>

<h2>What are you going to do with it?</h2>

<p>Good question, I&#8217;m thinking of setting up a virtualisation kind of thing, so my big server can pretend to be lots of smaller servers, useful for building client sites, experimental things, build servers etc. We&#8217;ll see</p>

<h2>Where do you start?</h2>

<p>Another good question. It comes with the Smart Manager application, which you can install on it to do lots of clever things, however, at the moment, I&#8217;ve not even fired it up to see if it has the remnants of an Operating System on it. I&#8217;m suspecting not!</p>

<h2>I&#8217;ve got one too, where do I start?</h2>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ve managed to find the user manual, you can download it yourself from the <a href="http://global-download.gateway.com/GDFiles/Document/User%20Manual/User%20Manual_Gateway_1.0_A_A.zip?acerid=634213526746016513&amp;Step1=Server&amp;Step2=Server&amp;Step3=GR380%20F1&amp;OS=303&amp;LC=en&amp;BC=Gateway&amp;SC=EMEA_27G">Acer site</a>.</p>

<p>If nothing else I&#8217;d like to have a look inside to see what sort of state it&#8217;s in. Then I need to work out how to attach the funky rack mounts to it, then I need to work out how to install Debian or Ubuntu on it (plus Xen probably for virtualisation).</p>

<p>Oh - it&#8217;ll need a name too!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Following on from getting <a href="http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/08/30/the-story-of-cathy-and-heathcliff">Cathy &amp; Heathcliff</a>, our internet enabled thermal printers up and running as part of the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project</a>, I wanted to see if I could get them running on steam power.</p>

<h2>Steam power</h2>

<p>Of course most electricity we get from the national grid has been generated by a steam turbine in a power station. I though, was thinking more of this kind of steam engine!</p>

<p><img src="/images/mamod-in-the-kitchen.jpg" alt="mamod in the kitchen" /></p>

<p>This is stationary steam engine, hand built in the West Midlands by a company called <a href="http://mamod.co.uk">Mamod</a> founded in 1937.</p>

<h2>Mamod 1335D SP5</h2>

<p>This specific model comes with a dynamo, dual cylinders and a generator, a 1335D. I wanted to see how much power it would output with the standard dynamo. The bulb was a 1.5V bulb, so I wasn&#8217;t expecting it to power an Arduino out of the box. I realise as well that the output would require stabilising and regulating. Cathy &amp; Heathcliff&#8217;s Arduino&#8217;s require 7-16V.</p>

<p><img src="/images/testing-the-voltage.jpg" alt="testing the voltage" /></p>

<p>And I was right! I lit the boiler using three of the solid fuel pellets and waited for pressure to build in the boiler.</p>

<h2>Pressure builds</h2>

<p>Once the pressure did start to build, it soon became obvious that there were a few leaks which meant that some pressure was going to be lost. I kept on attempting to start the engine, but it was a while before it was ready, around 10 pounds per square inch of pressure.</p>

<p>After starting, the generator produced a rather paltry, 0.7V, hardly enough to light the light!</p>

<h2>Best results</h2>

<p>I managed then to stop the engine and hold it, to let the pressure build. Once it reached about 15 psi, I started the engine again and tested the voltage. This time it made it up to 1.5V</p>

<p>After that run, the pressure dropped and the fuel began to run out, so that was that.</p>

<h2>Next Time</h2>

<p>The plan for next time will be to not even start the engine until the pressure reaches 15 psi. I might also try and extra fuel pellet to see if that helps maintain the pressure.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve ordered some <a href="http://sugru.co.uk">sugru</a> to try and fix the leak too! Will be interesting to see if it works.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Amazon Pickup Lockers</h2>

<p>This year, Amazon launched it&#8217;s Pick up lockers and Collection locations. A great idea for a mail order company, providing delivery alternatives for customers so they don&#8217;t have to put up with the, <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2012/aug/24/amazon-complaints-yodel-delivery-service">generally awful</a>, parcel delivery services. Having had parcels left outside houses and in rubbish bins, it&#8217;s good to know you can collect, at your convenience from a location you have chosen.</p>

<h2>The Oxford - Cambridge Railway</h2>

<p>Then, the other weekend, I was on a railway line I&#8217;d never been on before, the Bletchley to Bedford line, which joins the West Coast Main Line, to the Midland Main Line, serving lots of small stations on route. A lot of work has been done on the infrastructure recently, as <a href="http://www.railfuture.org.uk/ox-cam/">services get extended</a> from Bletchley towards Oxford, and hopefully one day, back towards Cambridge. The line will also be electrified as part of the <a href="http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/07/16/the-electrified-spine-and-the-rest-of-the-news/">&#8216;electric spine&#8217;</a>.</p>

<h2>How about&#8230;</h2>

<p>About half way along this route, is a massive Amazon warehouse. Although it is next to the railway line, it isn&#8217;t rail served, there are no sidings set up for transferring goods. It got me thinking though, if local and major railway stations had Amazon pick up lockers, then they could be rail served in a really efficient way. Of course there would be infrastructure costs, getting Amazon warehouses linked up, but once that was done, a really efficient way of delivering goods.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/scenic-railways.png" alt="screen shot of application" /></p>

<p>Thanks to the <a href="/2012/10/16/railway-hackday-off-the-rails/">Off The Rails</a> hackday, I was able to team up with some fellow software engineers to build something in a day. Our team consisted of <a href="http://twitter.com/frankieroberto">Frankie Roberto</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/jnicho02">Jez Nicholson</a>, and <a href="http://twitter.com/joooe">Joe Hughes</a>. Frankie had had the idea for building an application which would show sights of interest visible from the train route, indicating rough placements and which side of the train to look on. I knew Frankie from Sheffield, Frankie had worked with Jez before on a previous hackday and Joe was interested in what we were doing, our team was formed!</p>

<p>Interestingly, during the &#8216;speed dating&#8217; section at the beginning of the day, when we chatted to other people about their ideas and what they were thinking of building, one chap, whose name I think was Phil, was thinking about Railway iSpy, which sounds pretty similar to what we actually built (without Big Chief i-Spy though!). Our application also bears an uncanny similiarity to the Peppa Pig episode <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Htl6NYcBE-k">The Train Ride!</a></p>

<p>After some discussion on ideas, scope, implementation and the <a href="http://www.railperf.org.uk/">Railway Performance Society</a> we started building a Rails web application and an iOS app. Although I know a lot about railways, I&#8217;m still in the early days of learning Rails and iOS, so the patience of Jez and Frankie whilst building <a href="http://www.scenicrailways.org.uk">Scenic Railways</a> was much appreciated. So whilst the three of us built the web application, Joe got cracking with building an iOS application.</p>

<p><img src="/images/scenic-railways-on-iphone.png" alt="ios-1" /></p>

<p>We got an initial version built in the time we had (from about 11am until 7pm) before the presentations were due to start. I worked on a bit of map integration using <a href="http://leaflet.cloudmade.com">leaflet.js</a> whilst Jez and Frankie implemented the main structure.</p>

<p>Although the version we finished was relatively basic, there are some nice features, the best one being that the sides to look out of the window on, reverse depending on direction of travel!  It could easily be extended in the future to add extra routes and extra points of interest (POIs). Joe had some ideas on making the iOS app competitive, by providing incentives for people to take photos of the points from the train!</p>

<p><img src="/images/scenic-railways-1.png" alt="screen shot of application" /></p>

<p>So, feel free to have a look at the site <a href="http://www.scenicrailways.org.uk">Scenic Railways</a> and you can even checkout the code from <a href="https://github.com/frankieroberto/scenic-railways">github</a> and laugh at my Rails code (or lack of it!).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><img src="/images/off_the_rails_sponsors1.png" title="Off The Rails" alt="off the rails image" /></p>

<p>After being Technologist in Residence at <a href="http://sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> earlier in the year, as part of the <a href="http://happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance Project</a> I started to think of some ideas I wanted to follow for later in 2012.</p>

<h2>Hackday</h2>

<p>One of those ideas was to run a <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hack-days">Hackday</a>, but not any old Hackday, one centred around Railways. Network Rail had just opened up their realtime <a href="http://datafeeds.networkrail.co.uk">Datafeeds</a> and as far as I knew, no one else had ever run one. Sure, there had been Transport Hackdays, but not Railway specific ones.</p>

<h2>First steps</h2>

<p>So I got to work, I went to experience a 24 hour hackday for myself, where I discovered that sometimes technical issues with the building can really slow people&#8217;s progress and that working overnight doesn&#8217;t really suit me anymore!</p>

<h2>Clickerty Hack</h2>

<p>I also bought a domain and registered a Twitter account. The hackday would be called Clickerty Hack. Then, having a good read of <a href="http://hackdaymanifesto.com/">The Hackday Manifesto</a> made me realise that a lot of work was required to get a decent Hackday up and running.</p>

<h2>Loco 2 and Off The Rails</h2>

<p>It was then that I found out about somebody else&#8217;s plans for a Railway Hackday, <a href="http://loco2.com">loco2</a> was a company I was already watching with interest. A startup based around European Train travel, ticketing and guides.</p>

<p>Their hackday, Off the Rails, was in a more advanced state than Clickerty Hack, so putting it on hold, I volunteered to help.</p>

<h2>ShedCode Sponsorship</h2>

<p>It was a real privilege to be able to help with a small part of the organising and for my company <a href="http://shedcode.co.uk">ShedCode</a> to be one of the sponsors, providing some of the food for the masses!</p>

<h2>Meeting the experts</h2>

<p>During 2012, I&#8217;d found a number of people who had built some incredible pieces of software using Railway data, especially <a href="http://twitter.com/poggs">Peter Hicks</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/swlines">Tom Cairns</a> who built, amongst other things <a href="http://www.opentraintimes.com/">Open Train Times</a> and <a href="http://traintimes.im">Train Times</a> respectively. So it was brilliant to meet them in person at Off The Rails. There were also many other people knowledgeable about Railways, Open Data and Mapping - I could have spent all day just talking to people!</p>

<h2>The teams</h2>

<p>During the day, the teams built some inspiring things, including an application which builds spotify playlists to match the length of your train journey and many others. Most of them will hopefully be available at some point on github for perusal.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>All in all, a fantastic day, thanks to <a href="http://loco2.com">Loco2</a> and <a href="http://bethnalgreenventures.com">Bethnal Green Ventures</a> and here&#8217;s to the next Railway Hackday, whether it&#8217;s Off The Rails 2, or Clickerty Hack! With cake too of course ;)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Corporate Social Responsibility</h2>

<p>Corporate Social Responsibility is a huge field in modern times. Businesses vary in their response to the challenge of responsibility, from box ticking a checklist, to doubling up charitable donations, to actively encouraging employees to be involved in Charitable works.</p>

<p>My old company, <a href="http://www.technophobia.com">Technophobia</a> ran a FedEx day, where one of the challenges was for a team to rebuild a website for a charity, which they did. You can <a href="http://www.technophobia.com/blog/read/another-successful-innovation-day-407">read all about</a> it, good for them!</p>

<p>This year though, I&#8217;ve been thinking more about how companies could donate their employees and employee time to make a difference in more unusual ways.</p>

<h2>Technologist in Residence</h2>

<p>Having had the privilege of being a Technologist in Residence at the <a href="http://sitegallery.org">Site Gallery</a> earlier this year, I was able to see first hand what a difference a problem solving techie can make in a relatively small art&#8217;s organisation. With a Research and Development remit, as well as helping with some of the day-to-day tasks, a techie can enjoy the excitment of trying new things, whilst also being able to fix problems without the usual gubbins of working for a large corporation.</p>

<p>Of course, many arts organisations have a resident techie, but usually they have to spin many plates, from producing exhibitions, to maintaining the website, leaving little room for them to catch up with some of the more strategic things which need doing.</p>

<p>There is limited funding to run <a href="http://www.happenstanceproject.com">Happenstance</a> style residencies, and this is where local businesses could make a difference. By adopting a local arts organisation, getting involved, running events and allowing staff to spend a week once a year, then a day a month for the rest of the time, for example, the benefits would be felt by all.</p>

<h2>Who gains?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The arts organisation - they gain some help in fixing some things, as well as being inspired with new and interesting technology. Building relationships with the local tech community</li>
<li>The techies - they can hopefully have time to do experiments, R&amp;D, as well as doing some of the stuff which needs doing. From tidying networks, configuring firewalls, mending printers, redesigning websites, helping with copy… you get the picture!</li>
<li>The company - they help the local community, building relationships with organisations around and about, increasing their reach and network. Their employees are more inspired and excited about new things.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Who pays in these difficult times</h2>

<p>It would be completely understandable for tech companies to claim that they cannot afford to let their billable employees take time out of their billing cycle to do &#8216;good&#8217;. Understandable, but short sighted. It&#8217;s the same argument about sending employees on courses, or to conferences - &#8220;where is the business benefit?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Well, I believe that good, motivated employees are expensive to recruit and maintain, why risk them getting demotivated, bored and unhappy, when by giving them time to innovate and collaborate, they grow! So the risk is far greater, that you lose good people by not giving them the room to grow. Best to pay out of a sense of innovation and employee investment, than to pay the price for losing them, either by them leaving or by turning them in to faceless, billable resources.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The Creativity Tap</h2>

<p>Creativity is just like a tap right? You need to do some thing a bit woo and a bit wah, so you switch on the creativity tap and all these incredible ideas just pour out of your brain. There are two dangers though if you use the creativity tap.</p>

<p>One is that if you leave that tap switched off for a while, then all the creativity gets stored up in your brain, without an outlet until&#8230; Pop! One day it’s gone, those ideas had to go somewhere, so they leaked out, usually somewhere behind your ear, hopefully picked up by someone else. You have writers block, coders deadlock, songwriters&#8230; err, song block. Oh dear</p>

<p>The other danger is that you leave that tap switched on all the time until your brain empties. This too is a bad idea, sure, you’ve made some room in your noddle for new things, but you need a few left in there, to keep the ideas factory ticking over. Oh double dear&#8230;</p>

<h2>Writing Songs</h2>

<p>Knowing people who are songwriters, I get the privilege of seeing songs appear, until they end up being recorded and performed, or they mutate into a different song, or they end up on the shelf, maybe for another day. I’m sure not every songwriter works like this, but those I know have to <em>work</em> at honing a song. They rarely appear fully formed but they often appear when there is space in their lives to switch on the creativity tap for a bit to see what happens.</p>

<p>If they don’t have the chance to get the songs <em>out</em>, into the open, then you can see how those song ideas start to play merry hell. The frustration builds, no time for the songs, too busy having to do other stuff. It’s almost a physical pain, the song <em>has</em> to be brought to life. There is a creative imperative which must be fulfilled.</p>

<h2>Writing Code</h2>

<p>Fortunately, for us software engineers, coders, developers, tapping at our keyboards day by day, telling the computer what to do and when to do it, we don’t need the creativity tap. We get stuck? We ask a search engine. We need to do something from scratch? Well, <em>someone</em> will have done something like it, we just need to find it and copy them. We need another pair of eyes? Well, ask a colleague. It’s all there for us, if we use a clever framework or development environment, it’ll probably autocomplete what we’re thinking too. We are coding machines..</p>

<p>Or are we? Having spent many years writing code, I started to realise that when I was mechanistic in what I was doing, I became frustrated that I wasn’t able to come up with new ideas or ways of doing things. I was constrained by getting this piece of work finished in as short a period of time that was possible. No time to switch on the creativity tap, just <em>get it done</em>.</p>

<p>The big problem is when you work for someone else, you can find yourself under a lot of pressure to crank the sausage machine handle rather than think things through. I worked with an engineer once, who would deliberately stop what he was doing and just <em>think</em>. Rather than thrashing through a jungle of code&#8230; stop first and think. It worked too, giving a bit of time to turn on the creativity tap to see what happened.</p>

<p>I struggled in my day to day job, so I tried to make time in the evenings and the weekends. But you’re so tired then that switching on the creativity tap just floods you with ideas which you don’t have the energy to either make note of or do anything with. Like the frustrated songwriter I would feel the pain of not learning new skills, not playing with languages and technology. Not actually chuffing making anything which made you say, even if it is just to yourself “I made that and I’m pleased with what I’ve done”.</p>

<p>So, what can be done?</p>

<p>Well one answer, in the workplace, where people have a pressurised, day to day job and a boss, is for the bosses to give people time when they have the headspace to play. With their work, with something new, with wooden blocks, with a great idea they’ve had. Not only do they get chance to switch on the creativity tap, but usually it knocks on in to their ‘day to day’ work too. Wins all around.</p>

<p>If you are your own boss, then plan in time where you put down the work you’re doing for clients or your startup and have a play. You never know what amazing ideas might come to life!</p>

<p>Disclaimer - the creativity tap premise is a load of nonsense, if only it was a tap we could switch on and off!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The problem</h2>

<p>After migrating a WordPress site, auto update and plugin install wouldn&#8217;t work. The former errored with <code>could not connect to host</code> which seemed very odd.</p>

<h3>First attempts</h3>

<p>WordPress allows you to download the file manually or autoupdate if configured correctly. Clicking on the manual download link and the file downloaded fine to the local machine. So first, I thought I&#8217;d try and download the file from the command line on the new server.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>wget http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4.1.zip</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Zip, it all downloaded fine.</p>

<h3>Extra help</h3>

<p>There is a good trouble shooting/dev plugin for WordPress called <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/core-control/">Core Control</a>. By installing this and enabling the HTTP control, you can test the various transports WordPress uses for downloads. Curl, PHP File open, PHP Fsockopen etc.</p>

<p>Testing all three default transports, starting with cURL came up with the same message, <code>could not connect to host</code></p>

<h3>Head Scratching time</h3>

<p>So WordPress was telling the truth. Now, as WordPress was running as the <code>www-data</code> user, what happens if I tried the wget from the command line for that user?</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>wget http://wordpress.org/wordpress-3.4.1.zip
</span><span class='line'>Permission denied!</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ah-ha, so it was nothing to do with WordPress, the <code>www-data</code> user couldn&#8217;t download anything.</p>

<h3>Problem solved!</h3>

<p>Firewalls, I started thinking firewalls and lo and behold, <a href="https://projects.bytemark.co.uk/projects/24/wiki/Firewall">BytemarkUK block outgoing http traffic</a> for the www-data user by default! This makes sense for when sites get compromised, but it also stops some of the core functionality for updates etc working.</p>

<p>Enabling http traffic for the www-data user will make things worse if the site is compromised, but also makes it a lot easier to keep the site up to date, reducing the chances of a WordPress exploit.</p>

<p>The following removes the firewall rule</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>rm /etc/symbiosis/firewall/outgoing.d/50-www-data</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>
