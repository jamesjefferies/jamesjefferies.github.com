I found this via <a title="Basement" target="_blank" href="http://jamesandclare.net/life/basement.org">basement.org</a> and as I like underground maps and things like that, especially the London Underground, this made fascinating viewing.

The website has a proposed <a title="Kickmap" href="http://jamesandclare.net/life/www.kickmap.com">new design</a> of the New York Subway map and is well worth a look...
