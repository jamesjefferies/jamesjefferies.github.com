fÂ  you use instanceof or isInstance it will succeed if the class can be 'upcast', so if it inherits from what you're comparing it to..

``` java
classA instanceof classB
```
is true if classA is of a type inherited from classB
``` java
classA.getClass().isInstance(ClassB.class))
```
isInstance allows you to do it dynamically though
