You're not going to find the answer here (arf), but I love this [article](http://softwarecreation.org/2009/how-to-become-an-expert-top-7-qualities/) on what it takes to become an expert. This point I find particularly interesting:



> tacit knowledge: automatic, unexpressed knowledge that provides context for people, places, ideas, and experiences. Tacit knowledge is not easily shared. As Polanyi said: “We know more than we can tell.”



I like [this](http://www.scottberkun.com/blog/2009/top-ten-reasons-managers-become-great/) too, especially the point that managers become great if they are self aware - they know their weaknesses and they make sure someone is covering their back.
