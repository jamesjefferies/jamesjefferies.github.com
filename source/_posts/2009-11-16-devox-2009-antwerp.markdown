I'm really pleased to be at Devoxx this year which is the biggest Java conference in Europe. Today around 3000 people turned up for day 1 of the university sessions. I ended up going to the following sessions

1. Kanban methodology in the morning
2.  New features of JSF2 in the afternoon
3. Half hour session on hades and JPA
4. Half hour session on Spock, the testing framework.

See other posts for how I got on!
