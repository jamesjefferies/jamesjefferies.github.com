In all the rush of our baby arriving, we didn't feel able to start with re-usable nappies, but once we got in to the swing of things, we wanted to try a few different varieties to see what suited us most. Our pick of the bunch are the <a title="Flip" href="http://www.babame.com/flip.php">flip nappies</a>.

They are fab. We have two different liners, the super dry ones and the organic cloth ones. They both do the trick and although the organic ones are a bit bulkier, they both seem prettyÂ absorbent.

Adjustable? Yup, from little nippers up to big nippers... For the record, we started with Tesco's disposables. Although I can't stand Tesco, they got the good reviews and are good value. Wouldn't want to go back now though!
