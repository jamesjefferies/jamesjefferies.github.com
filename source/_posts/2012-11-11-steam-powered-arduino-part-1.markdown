Following on from getting [Cathy & Heathcliff](http://jamesjefferies.com/2012/08/30/the-story-of-cathy-and-heathcliff), our internet enabled thermal printers up and running as part of the [Happenstance Project](http://happenstanceproject.com), I wanted to see if I could get them running on steam power. Of course most electricity we get from the national grid has been generated by a steam turbine in a power station. I was thinking more of this kind of steam engine!

This is stationary steam engine, hand built in the West Midlands by a company called [Mamod](http://mamod.co.uk) founded in 1937. 

This specific model comes with a dynamo, dual cylinders and a generator, a 1335D. I wanted to see how much power it would output with the standard dynamo. The bulb was a 1.5V bulb, so I wasn't expecting it to power an Arduino out of the box.
