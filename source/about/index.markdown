{% img left /about/jamesjefferies-photo.jpg 200 200 James Jefferies  %}James has spent most of the last 17 years as a software engineer, problem solver and web developer. The first website he ever worked on was [the Barclays Bank homepage](http://www.barclays.co.uk) back in 1995. Since then he has worked for Yorkshire Electricity and the Sheffield based digital agency Technophobia. 

Last year he turned freelance with his own company, [ShedCode](http://shedcode.co.uk), and is now able to work on the kind of projects he always dreamt about. The first of those projects was [Happenstance](http://happenstanceproject.com), a Digital R&D funded project where he was Technologist in Residence at Site Gallery, Sheffield. As part of his residency, he had the opportunity to work with Arduino kits, re-igniting his interest in making things work with electronics.

One of his latest projects is to create a steam powered, internet enabled,  thermal printer from existing kits and components.

You can watch his [TEDx talk](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSheffield-2012-Leila-Johnst) about the Happenstance project.
