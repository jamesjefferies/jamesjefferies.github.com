{% img left /about/jamesjefferies-photo.jpg 200 200 James Jefferies  %}James has spent most of the last 17 years as a software engineer, problem solver and web developer. The first website he ever worked on was www.barclays.co.uk back in 1995. Since then he has worked for Yorkshire Electricity and the Sheffield based digital agency Technophobia. 

Last year he turned freelance with his own company, ShedCode, and is now able to work on the kind of projects he always dreamt about. The first of those projects was [Happenstance](http://happenstanceproject.com), a Digital R&D funded project where he was Technologist in Residence at Site Gallery, Sheffield.

You can watch his [TEDx talk](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxSheffield-2012-Leila-Johnst) about the Happenstance project.
