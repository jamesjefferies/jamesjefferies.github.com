###### note - draft, awaiting Access MDB files & licencing info

## NMSI data

These data sets contain information about objects from the collections of the Science Museum, the National Media Museum and the National Railway Museum. Itâ€™s likely to be a bit out of date, but still useful. The data is all in large csv formatted files.

It is released under a CC BY-NC-SA license

[NMSI Api](http://api.sciencemuseum.org.uk/documentation/collections/)

### Archive Lists (with license) 

The drawing lists from this page are released under a CC0 licence 

[Railway Works](http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections/RailwayCoWorks.aspx)

### Archive Lists (no license at present)

This data has only recently been added. The data is somewhat inconsistent and takes the form of PDFs or Word Docs. We also have these in a more, err, raw format, Access db mdb files. 

[Archive](http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections)

The NRM would be interested to see if anyone could get these data sets in to a more friendly, usable, interesting format.

###Archive Drawings (no license)

These drawings match up with the lists in the archive, however they are not linked on the website.
